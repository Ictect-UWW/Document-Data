Eminently interesting, are bone and joint injuries/disorders because of the low self-regenerating capacity of the matrix secreting cells, particularly chondrocytes. ES cells have the unlimited capacity to self-renew and maintain their pluripotency in culture. Upon induction of various signals they will then differentiate into distinctive cell types such as neurons, cardiomyocytes and osteoblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We present here that BMP-2 can drive ES cells to the cartilage, osteoblast or adipogenic fate depending on supplementary co-factors. TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, insulin and ascorbic acid were identified as signals that together with BMP-2 induce a chondrocytic phenotype that is characterized by increased expression of cartilage marker genes in a timely co-ordinated fashion. Expression of collagen type IIB and aggrecan, indicative of a fully mature state, continuously ascend until reaching a peak at day 32 of culture to approximately 80-fold over control values. Sox9 and scleraxis, cartilage specific transcription factors, are highly expressed at very early stages and show decreased expression over the time course of EB differentiation. Some smaller proteoglycans, such as decorin and biglycan, are expressed at earlier stages. Overall, proteoglycan biosynthesis is up-regulated 7-fold in response to the supplements added. BMP-2 induced chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy and begin to alter their expression profile towards osteoblasts. Supplying mineralization factors such as &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate and vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>with the culture medium can facilitate this process. Moreover, gene expression studies show that adipocytes can also differentiate from BMP-2 treated ES cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ultimately, we have found that ES cells can be successfully triggered to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells, which can further alter their fate to become hypertrophic, and adipocytes. Compared with previous reports using a brief BMP-2 supplementation early in differentiation, prolonged exposure increased chondrogenic output, while supplementation with insulin and ascorbic acid prevented dedifferentiation. These results provide a foundation for the use of ES cells as a potential therapy in joint injury and disease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Articular cartilage is composed of extracellular matrix (ECM), the matrix-secreting chondrocyte and water, which all account for the tissue's characteristic rigidity as well as its flexibility. These features are necessary in order to warrant life-long survival of the cartilage tissue, especially in the joint where it has to endure pressure forces caused by movement. Chondrocytes arise from a mesenchymal progenitor during development, the same progenitor that gives rise to other mesenchymal cell types including osteoblasts, adipocytes and myocytes. Bone formation can either be endochondral, when chondrocytes mature and calcify to provide a matrix for the invading osteoprogenitors, or intramembraneous involving ossification directly from a mesenchymal ancestor. All these diverse cell types may arise from the same precursor, but are distinguished by specific morphological features and with that, a certain set of characteristic proteins including transcription factors that control their differentiation.</p><p>Two chondrocyte-specific transcription factors have been identified, Sox9, a member of the SOX-family of transcription factors, and Scleraxis, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, most of the exclusive markers for cartilage tissue reside in the ECM. The predominant form of collagen in mature cartilage is collagen type IIB, whereas the alternatively spliced collagen IIA is found primarily during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan species in cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The transition of chondrocytes into hypertrophy is distinguished by a change in expression of Cbfa1, the osteoblast-specific transcription factor, which is also switched on during intramembraneous ossification. Distinctive to cartilage, the major collagen molecule in osseus matrix is collagen type I. In contrast, the transcription factors controlling adipogenesis are C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;, which transactivate subsets of genes as a function of either trans-acting factor alone or requiring the co-operative effort of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. C/EBP&#x003b1; is known to bind to and transactivate particularly the promotors of the SCD1, aP2 and the Glut4 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], all highly characteristic of the adipocyte phenotype.</p><p>For decades, the treatment of degenerative cartilage and bone diseases has been a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons due to the apparent inability of cartilage and bone to repair itself. Arthritis, a degenerative joint condition, is one of the most prevalent chronic health conditions in North America. Arthritis can devastate people, but to date there is no effective therapy available and patients can only be helped by surgical joint replacement. An inherent major concern is the limited availability of autografts, which significantly reduces the choice of treatable defects. However, new approaches to cell grafting are being developed in this field: increased yields of cells are achieved by the usage of bioreactors and growth factor administration, such as TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and BMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Additionally, stem cells are being discovered as a new source of transplantable material.</p><p>Embryonic stem cells represent a valuable source for cell transplantation since their characteristic features include an unlimited self-renewing capacity and a multilineage differentiation potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In fact, ES-derived glial precursors and cardiomyocytes have been successfully transplanted, integrated and shown to be functionally active in the transplantation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The yield of differentiation of ES cells into an intended lineage can be greatly enhanced by the addition of growth factors or induction substances. Whereas protocols for the differentiation of cardiomyocytes, neuronal cell types, insulin-producing cells or adipocytes from ES cells have been available for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], only recently their differentiation into elements of the skeleton has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our group has previously shown that vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>forces ES cells to undergo osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Kramer et al. have reported in 2000 that BMP-2 pushes ES cells to the chondrogenic fate when added during days 3&#x02013;5 of EB differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Those ES-derived chondrocytes possess a certain plasticity to undergo hypertrophy and calcify [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>We show here, that prolonged treatment of differentiating ES cell cultures with BMP-2 in synergy with TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, insulin and ascorbic acid leads to improved chondrogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Compared to the brief supplementation described by Kramer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the expression of chondrocyte-specific marker genes was highly up-regulated while proteoglycan content revealed an increased chondrocytic yield from 7.26% to 57.03%. As described by other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], ES-derived chondrocytes become hypertrophic and calcify. However, spontaneous calcification did not reach mineralization levels that are found in vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>induced ES-derived osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Yet, supplementation of chondrocyte-cultures with &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid and vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>starting at day 20 rescued the osteoblast phenotype. In many differentiations, we also observed an accumulation of lipid droplets and an up-regulation of adipocyte-specific genes. This direction towards adipocyte differentiation varied with the use of specific co-factors, suggesting that in the future, such spurious differentiation may be controlled, once the pathways involved in adipogenesis are better understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of chondrocyte-like cells derived from ES cells</title><p>Embryonic stem cell cultures supplemented with BMP-2, TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, insulin and ascorbic acid show typical morphological changes compared to the untreated cultures. Starting with the fourth week of culture, aggregates consisting of small round cells formed in the supplemented cultures, which stained positive with alcian blue (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Little alcian blue staining was seen in control cultures (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Polygonal cells, which could also be found in treated cultures, did not stain with alcian blue. Significant immunostaining for the collagen type II (COL II) protein was observed at day 32 in treated cultures corresponding to the active secretion and formation of an extracellular matrix found with chondrocytes. The COL II antibody identified the fibrillary organization of the collagen molecules in the extracellular matrix (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Chondrogenic differentiation was confirmed by positive immunostaining for adult proteoglycans (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), which is detectable in the aggregates identified by alcian blue staining. The distribution was associated with the extracellular matrix similar to that found with the COL II antibody. Staining appeared to be diffuse as extracellular matrix and not individual cells are stained.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Morphology and characteristics of ES-derived chondrocytes after 32 days of culture.

Previously, chondrogenesis was induced in ES cells using 2 ng/ml BMP-2 on days three to five of EB formation, when early mesodermal markers such as <italic>Brachyury </italic>and <italic>BMP-4 </italic>are expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To improve chondrogenesis, we investigated whether a higher concentration of BMP-2 (10 ng/ml) could increase chondrocyte-specific gene expression. Total RNA was extracted on day 32 and quantitative real-time PCR was carried out. Expression of genes of interest in cultures supplemented with 10 ng/ml BMP-2 was normalized to GAPDH expression and compared to cultures supplemented with 2 ng/ml (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), which were set as 1. Expression of the small leucine-rich proteoglycans biglycan and decorin was increased 1.6 fold upon supplementation with 10 ng/ml BMP-2 (P &#x0003c; 0.01). Neither link protein expression nor Sox9 or scleraxis expression were affected by the higher dosage. However, expression of aggrecan and the collagen type II isoforms A and B, which are specific for mature chondrocytes, were significantly increased compared to the low BMP-2 concentration described by Kramer et al. (P &#x0003c; 0.001). The degree of chondrogenic differentiation under influence of BMP-2 was further quantified by metachromatic detection of proteoglycans (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Secreted proteoglycans were extracted on day 32 of culture with guanidine/HCl and combined with dimethylmethylenblue. Based on our measurement of aggrecan, the synthesis of proteoglycan proteins is also increased under the influence of BMP-2. BMP-2 at 2 ng/ml initiated an induction in proteoglycan synthesis of about 2 fold (P &#x0003c; 0.01), whereas 10 ng/ml BMP-2 increased the proteoglycan content of EBs 2.3 fold (P &#x0003c; 0.1) compared to non-treated controls. This data shows, that BMP-2 causes the induced synthesis of negatively charged extracellular matrix, characterized by proteoglycans.</p></sec><sec><title>Additive effect of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, insulin and ascorbic acid on BMP-2 induced chondrogenesis</title><p>Since BMP-2 is believed to play a role in late chondrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we studied the effect of prolonged BMP-2 supplementation beyond day 5 of culture. Additionally, the anabolic effect of insulin and ascorbic acid and the influence of the growth factor TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>on BMP-2 induced differentiation was determined quantitatively by PCR analysis at various stages throughout EB differentiation. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the particular combinations of medium supplements used at different culture stages of the 'hanging drop' protocol used for differentiation, in which day 1&#x02013;3 represent the hanging drop stage. During days 3&#x02013;5 the resulting embryoid bodies are cultured in suspension and then plated onto tissue culture treated plastic ware on day 5. Applied concentrations were 10 ng/ml BMP-2, 2 ng/ml TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ascorbic acid. Dexamethasone, which is also known to be a chondro-inducing agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], did not evoke a mentionable chondrogenic response in the D3 ES cell line (data not shown). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows changes in cartilage-specific gene expression under the influence of various differentiation co-factors throughout the 32 days of culture. TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>(combination B) evoked a 2-fold increase in collagen II expression for both splice forms. The synergistic effect of both growth factors, TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and BMP-2 (combination C) began to show an increased expressions of aggrecan, link protein and COL IIA compared to cultures that were treated with one supplement alone. Additional supplementation with insulin and ascorbic acid between culture days 3 and 5 (combination D) barely increased aggrecan, link protein and COL II expression, but when given from day 5 onwards enhanced both the BMP-2 and TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>effects (supplement combinations E and H). Addition of insulin and ascorbic acid to BMP-2 induced cultures increased collagen type IIA and aggrecan expression minimally to 1.2-fold, link protein and collagen type IIB were induced 2.7- to 2.8-fold compared to BMP-2 alone. The TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>response was increased 3- to 4-fold. When cultures were induced with BMP-2 and TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>in suspension (d3&#x02013;5) and supplemented with insulin and ascorbic acid starting on day 5 onwards (combination F), aggrecan, link protein and COL II were up-regulated 10-fold compared to controls.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Combinations of medium supplements used at different culture stages</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Supplement combination</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Day 3&#x02013;5 (hanging drops)</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Day 5 onwards (attached culture)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>A</bold></td><td align="left">BMP-2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>B</bold></td><td align="left">TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>C</bold></td><td align="left">BMP-2<break/>TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>D</bold></td><td align="left">BMP-2<break/>TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub><break/>insulin<break/>ascorbic acid</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>E</bold></td><td align="left">BMP-2</td><td align="left">insulin<break/>ascorbic acid</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>F</bold></td><td align="left">BMP-2<break/>TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub></td><td align="left">insulin<break/>ascorbic acid</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>G</bold></td><td align="left">BMP-2<break/>TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub></td><td align="left">insulin<break/>ascorbic acid<break/>BMP-2</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>H</bold></td><td align="left">TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub></td><td align="left">insulin<break/>ascorbic acid</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Applied concentrations were 10 ng/ml BMP-2, 2 ng/v ml TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ascorbic acid.

Since the extent of changes in cartilage-specific genes seemed to be dependent on acute (d 3&#x02013;5) or chronic (d 3&#x02013;32) application of BMP-2 (supplement combination F versus supplement combination G), the stronger induction by chronic supplementation of BMP-2 was monitored throughout the culture duration. During the first three weeks of the BMP-2 induced differentiation, only minor changes in aggrecan, link protein or collagen type II expression could be detected. Starting with day 26 however, aggrecan expression was up-regulated significantly to 14-fold over control niveaus (P &#x0003c; 0.1). Reaching day 32, aggrecan, link protein and collagen type II A and B approached peak levels. Consistent with the aggrecan expression profile, link protein expression was found to be significantly up-regulated on days 24&#x02013;27 (factor 6.3; P = 0.001). Increased values were detectable as early as day 16. On day 26, the quantification of the collagen type IIA and B showed 11- and 24-fold increases respectively. On day 14, splice form B had already reached an 8-fold increase over control values. In contrast, during the early phases of differentiation, between day 5 and 20, collagen type IIA expression was continuously increased 2-fold. Transcripts for biglycan and decorin were detectable throughout all stages of chondrogenic differentiation. With the beginning of the maturation phase in the fourth week of culture (day 21&#x02013;28), both genes were up-regulated 1.5&#x02013;2 fold.

To test whether this was true for the ES-derived chondrocytes generated with our protocol, we assayed for the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>content of the cultures, a measure for mineralization (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Calcium was increased 1.2-fold in cells that were supplemented with BMP-2, TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, insulin and ascorbic acid compared to controls (P &#x0003c; 0.01). Previously, we have described the induction of mineralization in osteoblasts derived from ES cells with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, which reach maturity at day 32 of culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Here, we observed that the level of mineralization was considerably higher in direct osteoblast differentiation [11.57 mg/dl] compared to indirect differentiation using our improved chondrocyte protocol [3.22 mg/dl]. We observed, however, that the level of calcium found in VD<sub>3 </sub>induced ES-derived osteoblasts could be rescued in the chondrocytes by adding VD<sub>3 </sub>on day 20 of differentiation, a time when chondrocytes could be morphologically identified in the cultures (11.18 mg/dl, P &#x0003c; 0.001). As shown by quantitative RT-PCR, VD<sub>3 </sub>treated ES cell derived chondrocytes could alter their expression profile to that of d32 ES cell derived osteoblasts (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). However, expression of osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein was less than in VD<sub>3 </sub>rescued chondrocyte cultures than in VD<sub>3 </sub>osteoblast cultures. Interestingly, chondrocyte-specific genes could not be detected in VD<sub>3 </sub>osteoblasts and waned in VD<sub>3 </sub>rescued chondrocytes.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> shows these black cells in the VD<sub>3 </sub>treated cultures. No such cells are visible in control cultures or in ES-derived chondrocyte differentiations. However, by adding VD<sub>3 </sub>back in at day 20 to the chondrocytes, mineralization can be detected, although the localization pattern is slightly different.

In the early phase of differentiation, BMP-2 operates by directing differentiation towards the cartilage lineage and acting on chondroprogenitors. During later differentiation adding mineralizing agents can trigger hypertrophy and mineralization of the ES-derived chondrocytes. In the embryo, maturation of chondrocytes in the process of endochondral ossification follows a timely regulated developmental program, whereby cellular stages can be delimitated molecularly. During ES cell differentiation into chondrocytes, developmental processes follow the same pattern, as judged by the gene expression patterns observed. Chondrocytes, osteoblasts and adipocytes are thought to arise from the same mesenchymal progenitor. Based on our previous observations around VD<sub>3</sub>-induced osteogenesis, we have already hypothesized that during the first 5 days of differentiation mesodermal progenitors develop, which then are susceptible to the VD<sub>3 </sub>treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Treatment of the cultures with TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>at days 3&#x02013;5 may augment the number of mesenchymal progenitors, as TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>is thought to inhibit the proliferation of most cells, but to stimulate some mesenchymal cells such as osteoblasts and chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It was not surprising to see adipocytes develop in many of our cultures, as they represent another member of the TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>promoted mesodermal lineage.</p><p>The gain of adipose characteristics in culture is hallmarked by: a) the appearance of cytoplasmic lipid droplets, b) the acquisition of insulin sensitivity with regard to glucose uptake (GLUT4) and c) the expression and secretion of numerous bioactive molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. All of these characteristics of <italic>in vivo </italic>adipogenesis were met in the EBs treated with BMP-2, TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, insulin and ascorbic acid. Indeed, a future challenge for improving adipogenic cultures will be the discovery of regulatory pathways in adipogenesis. Once identified, such pathways may be antagonized in order to enhance ES differentiation into chondrocytes.</p><p>During the revision of this paper, a study was published describing that the overexpression of the sox triad, namely Sox9, Sox5 and Sox6, markedly increased chondrocyte marker gene expression (collagen type 2, aggrecan) in ES cells within 3 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Here, TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, BMP-2, IGF-1 and FGF-2 had no affect on the immediate regulation of these genes. In our differentiation system, Sox9 is elevated very early during differentiation at day 5 (data not shown) underlining its role as an early controller of chondrogenesis. We have shown here that BMP-2 regulates later processes in cartilage development. Marker gene expression levels reached upon overexpression of the Sox trio do not meet the levels we have observed in this study, suggesting that Sox9 may be necessary but not sufficient do direct all progenitors to the chondrocytic lineage.</p><p>Earlier this year, another study portrayed chondrogenesis in ES cells using encapsulation in alginate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The usage of a 3D culture system led to an increase in Col II and aggrecan expression of about 1.5- to 2-fold above the regular 2D system of plating EBs. Comparing those values to the 80- to 90-fold up-regulation described here, it is clear that three-dimensional signals also need to be incorporated into chondrocyte differentiations to increase differentiation efficiency.</p><p>Articular cartilage has been refractory to repair following degeneration. Despite its limited capacity to self-repair, cartilage is replete with cells capable of undergoing mitotic division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

Engineering bone or cartilage usually requires the handling of autologous cells. Cells are released from the ECM using collagenase and hyaluronidase. However, the small number of available progenitors, within the tissue can be problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Moreover, the ability of these harvested cells to proliferate is limited in the elderly, where most degenerative joint disorders occur. The outcome of conventional surgical treatment including joint resurfacing or biological autografts has been unsatisfactory following long-term evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This failure is caused by insufficient repair resulting in the formation of mechanically inadequate resident fibrocartilage.
