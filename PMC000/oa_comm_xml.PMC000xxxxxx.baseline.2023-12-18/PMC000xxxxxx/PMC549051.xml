No difference was observed in the proportion in peripheral blood lymphocytes between tumor bearing mice and normal mice, while there was a significant increase in the proportion in spleen lymphocytes in tumor bearing mice as compared with normal mice. Moreover, the proportion increased in accordance with the increase in the tumor sizes. The increase in the proportion was due to the decrease in CD4+ in lymphocytes, which is resulted from decreased CD4+CD25- subset in lymphocytes. Our observation suggests the CD4+CD25+/CD4+ proportion in spleen lymphocytes might be a sensitive index to evaluate the T<sub>R </sub>in tumor mouse models, and our results provide some information on strategies of antitumor immunotherapy targeting CD4+CD25+ regulatory T lymphocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells</kwd><kwd>mouse tumor model</kwd><kwd>splenic lymphocytes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Early in 1970s, the concept of suppressor T cells was developed and it was envisioned that this subset of lymphocytes was responsible for the active control, and ultimately the termination, of immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. But the characters of this subset had not been well studied mainly because its distinct phenotype was not identified. In 1990s, Sakaguchi et al found that a subset of CD4+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood of normal mice expressed the IL-2R-&#x003b1; (CD25) and it down-regulated the immune response to self and non-self antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Soon the CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes were verified as one group of suppressor T cell and termed as thymic derived "naturally occurring" regulatory T cells (T<sub>R</sub>). T<sub>R </sub>represents a minor (5&#x02013;10%) component of peripheral CD4+ T cells but plays an important role in controlling immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Accumulating evidences show that T<sub>R </sub>cells possess potent suppressive activity both in vivo and in vitro and are involved in autoimmune diseases, transplantation tolerance and tumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The transfer of CD4+CD25- cells into nude mice resulted in autoimmune diseases; reconstitution of CD4+CD25+ cells after transfer of CD4+CD25- cells prevented the development of autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Similarly, depletion of these cells induced gastritis and late-onset diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], impaired development or dysfunction of these cells increased susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and other autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Conversely, an increased percentage of CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells in total CD4+ T cells was found in peripheral blood of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and depletion of CD25+ cells alone or combination with other strategies might cause tumor regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. All these studies indicated the importance of T<sub>R </sub>cells in controlling immune response. The mechanism of how the T<sub>R </sub>cells control immune response is still unclear. Previous studies show that activated T<sub>R </sub>cells strongly inhibit proliferative responses of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], moreover, it down-regulates co-stimulatory molecules on dendritic cells (DC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], inhibit the maturation and antigen-presenting function of DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and suppress activated and matured DC driven responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The important role of T<sub>R </sub>cells in immunoregulation makes it be recognized as an attractive therapeutic target for immune-related diseases.</p><p>In our animal experiments of antitumor immunotherapy that targeting CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells, to our surprise, we did not find an increase of CD4+CD25+/CD4+ in peripheral blood of tumor bearing BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice, this is not in accordance with the increase of the proportion in cancer patients as reported by Wolf et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In order to find a way to evaluate the CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells in tumor-bearing mice, we analyzed CD4+CD25+ subset in peripheral blood and spleen lymphocytes from normal or C26 colon-carcinoma-bearing mice by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and tumor model</title><p>6 to 8 weeks BALB/c mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Sun Yet-sen University.

These cells are proven to be involved in autoimmune diseases, transplantation tolerance and tumor immunity, etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The relationship between cancer and immune system has been studied and debated for a long time, now we know that immunodeficient or immunosuppressed humans or animals show greater incidences of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; at the same time, immune function in cancer patients are often compromised by tumor itself or related treatment, and this often leads patients to disadvantageous situation. To restore the immune function in cancer patients is an important element in cancer treatment. The identification of CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells provided a new way to study relationship between tumor development and immune suppression. A higher proportion of CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells was found in peripheral blood of cancer patients and to be related to poor prognosis of the diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Depletion of CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells using anti-CD25 mAb could promote anti-tumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. All these indicated that CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells maybe an attractive target to restore or improve immune function in cancer treatment.</p><p>In our animal experiments of antitumor immunotherapy, we did not find an increase of CD4+CD25+/CD4+ in peripheral blood in tumor bearing BALB/c mice, this is not in accordance with the results in cancer patients reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To find a way to evaluate the CD4+CD25+/CD4+ in antitumor immunotherapy targeting CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells, we analyzed the proportion in peripheral blood and spleen lymphocytes in normal or C26 colon-carcinoma-bearing mice by flow cytometry. In present study, the proportion of CD4+CD25+/CD4+ in peripheral blood of normal mice was about 6.19%, which was compatible with the results reported previously (5&#x02013;10%). But in spleen lymphocytes from normal mice, we found a higher proportion of CD4+CD25+/CD4+ (around 10%), and the higher proportion is due to a lower level of total CD4+ lymphocytes in spleen, compared with that in peripheral blood, whereas the percentages of the CD4+CD25+ cells are similar.</p><p>In C26-colon-carcinoma bearing BALB/c mice, we found an increase of CD4+CD25+/CD4+ in spleen but not in peripheral blood, furthermore, the proportion in spleen lymphocytes increased with the increase of tumor sizes. The phenomenon that the increase of the proportion in spleen separates with that in peripheral blood may be due to: 1). Spleen is a professional immune organ, which maybe more sensitive to the changes of immune situation than peripheral blood; 2). In this study, what we used is artificial tumor model, not spontaneous tumor model, and the tumor grew so quickly to cause mice moribund or dead that the increase of the proportion did not appear in peripheral blood. To observe the increase of the proportion in peripheral blood of tumor bearing mice may need a longer observation duration, or had better use spontaneous tumor models. In our experiments, we found the increase of CD4+CD25+/CD4+ is due to the decrease of CD4+ in lymphocytes, which is the result of decreased CD4+CD25- subset in lymphocytes. Our results support the observations reported by Sasada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], in which the relative increase in the proportion of CD4+CD25+ T cells in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies are due to a selective reduction in the number of CD4+CD25- T cells. A possible explanation for this is that CD4+CD25- subset is more sensitive to clonal deletion or apoptosis than CD4+CD25+ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, it is possible that some factors, such as tumor-derived antigens or molecules, can induce apoptosis selectively in the CD4+CD25- subset but not in the CD4+CD25+ subset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between cancer and immune system has been debated for a long time. Our results provided direct evidence that the tumor might compromise the immune function, since our tumor model was established on BALB/c mice with normal immune function. It is known that tumor cells secrete immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and the cytokines may induce CD4+CD25- lymphocytes to convert to CD4+CD25+ T<sub>R </sub>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These all support the theory that tumor may compromise the immune function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In normal BALB/c mice, CD4+CD25+/CD4+ proportion in spleen lymphocytes is higher than that in peripheral blood lymphocytes. In C26-colon-carcinoma bearing mice, no difference was found in the proportion in peripheral blood lymphocytes compared with normal mice; Otherwise, the proportion in spleen lymphocytes obviously increased, moreover, the proportion increased in accordance with the increase of tumor sizes. The increase of the proportion is due to the decrease of total CD4+ in lymphocytes, which is resulted from decreased CD4+CD25- subset in lymphocytes. Our observation suggest the CD4+CD25+/CD4+ proportion in spleen lymphocytes might be a sensitive index to evaluate the T<sub>R </sub>in tumor mouse models rather than that in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and our results provide some information on strategies of antitumor immunotherapy targeting CD4+CD25+ regulatory T lymphocytes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported partly by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2004035180).</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Feinberg</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Silvestri</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>T<sub>(S) </sub>cells and immune tolerance induction: a regulatory renaissance?</article-title><source>Nat Immunol</source><year>2002</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>215</fpage><lpage>217</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11875459</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/ni0302-215</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sakaguchi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sakaguchi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Asano</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Itoh</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Toda</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Immunologic self-tolerance maintained by activated T cells expressing IL-2 receptor alpha-chains (CD25).
