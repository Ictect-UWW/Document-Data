We included trials comparing salmeterol or formoterol with placebo or with ipratropium bromide and reporting one of these outcomes: lung function; exercise capacity; quality of life scores; dyspnea; exacerbations; rescue inhaler use; incidence of tachycardia, hypokalemia, or dry mouth. Two reviewers assessed the quality of included reports using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment, and abstracted data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twelve trials satisfied our inclusion criteria; eight were high quality (Jadad score &#x0003e;2) and four were low quality (&#x02264; 2).

They modestly improve forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and reduce dynamic hyperinflation; breathlessness may lessen and exercise tolerance increase despite little improvement in spirometric measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The bronchodilators currently available for COPD include &#x003b2;2 agonists (e.g., salbutamol and salmeterol), anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium bromide) and methylxanthines (e.g., theophylline).</p><p>According to the Canadian guidelines for the treatment of stable COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] first line treatment consists of ipratropium, two to four doses three to four times daily, plus a short acting &#x003b2;2 agonist administered on an "as needed" basis. If the patient uses substantial amounts of short acting &#x003b2;2 agonists, or if the symptoms are greater at night than in the early morning, a long acting &#x003b2;2 agonist (salmeterol or formoterol) is added twice daily. However, recently some have recommended the latter as first line agents for stable COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] potentially replacing the less expensive ipratropium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Several trials have demonstrated the usefulness of salmeterol and formoterol for the management of COPD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. According to a 1998 meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], in patients with non-reversible COPD these agents produce small increases in FEV1; however, these changes alone may not correlate highly with symptom relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The authors of the meta-analysis suggested that these drugs be prescribed only for patients who find they provide definite clinical improvement: reduced breathlessness or better exercise capacity. All three trials in the meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. compared long acting &#x003b2;2 agonists with placebo. Since then, other studies of these agents in COPD, including comparisons with anticholinergics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] have appeared in the literature.</p><p>Canadian provincial drug plan managers have noted a substantial increase in the use of salmeterol and formoterol in recent years, an observation supported by data from International Medical Services Canada, which collects information on Canadian patterns of drug prescribing and estimates use: between 1997 and 2001, the use of salmeterol and formoterol for COPD increased 1,150% and 1,975%, respectively, whereas the use of ipratropium for COPD decreased by 37% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In light of the new trials and the recent changes in prescribing practices, we undertook a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long acting &#x003b2;2 agonists when compared with placebo or anticholinergic agents in patients with stable, poorly reversible, COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Searching</title><p>We obtained published literature and conference abstracts for this document from two separate sources: (1) search results from the CCOHTA's published health technology review "Long-acting &#x003b2;2-agonists for maintenance therapy of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review"; and, (2) search results from CCOHTA's ongoing clinical review on long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists for maintenance treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mixed population. The first search was performed on MEDLINE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, EMBASE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, HealthSTAR, BIOSIS Previews<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>in June 2001 using a sensitive search strategy. The second search performed in December 2002 had a more focused search strategy and included PASCAL, SciSearch and ToxFile databases in addition to MEDLINE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, EMBASE<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>and BIOSIS Previews<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>databases. As designed in the search strategy, this search captured all the studies included in CCOHTA's published review as well as some additional trials published since previous search date. Search details for both searches can be found in Appendix 2 [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. Regular alerts have been established on these databases to capture new studies and are ongoing in 2004. Parallel searches were performed and updated in PubMed and the Cochrane Library. In addition, we periodically searched Web sites of clinical trial registries and health technology assessment (HTA) and related agencies. Google&#x02122; and other search engines were used to retrieve conference abstracts of major respiratory associations. We also hand searched selected journals and documents in the library of the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment and the bibliographies of retrieved reports. As well, we contacted the Canadian offices of the manufacturers of salmeterol and formoterol for nonconfidential information on unpublished studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection</title><p>Two reviewers (D R H and V K S) worked independently on these phases of the study. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus; a neutral third party (M B) was consulted when necessary.</p><p>The reviewers evaluated the 504 unique citations by reviewing titles and abstracts, discarding those deemed irrelevant (e.g., case reports, review articles, and studies unrelated to the use of &#x003b2;2 agonists for maintenance treatment of stable COPD). They then selected all reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing salmeterol or formoterol with placebo or an anticholinergic agent, with or without the additional use of short acting &#x003b2;2 agonists. No restrictions were placed on dosage, but the trials had to be of either parallel or crossover design, have lasted four weeks or longer, and have included patients that met each of the following criteria.</p><p>&#x02022; Non-asthmatic.</p><p>&#x02022; Stable COPD: no infections, exacerbations, or hospitalizations in the past month.</p><p>&#x02022; FEV1 &#x02264; 75% of predicted.</p><p>&#x02022; Ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) &#x02264; 88% of predicted.</p><p>&#x02022; After a dose of a short or long acting &#x003b2;2 agonist &#x0003c; 15% improvement in FEV1.</p><p>Since bronchodilators are much more efficacious in asthma than in COPD, including patients with asthma would have influenced the findings. It may be difficult to determine whether chronic airflow obstruction with relatively large responses to short acting &#x003b2;2 agonists represents COPD with reversibility or asthma with incomplete reversibility. A suggestive feature in the differential diagnosis of COPD is irreversible airflow limitation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] To better reflect this and to minimize the chance of including patients with asthma, we excluded those trials in which the average FEV1 response to a bronchodilator was greater than or equal to 15%.</p><p>In addition, the trials had to have investigated one of the following outcomes.</p><p>&#x02022; Lung function, including FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).</p><p>&#x02022; Exercise capacity: six minute or shuttle walking test.</p><p>&#x02022; Health related quality of life (QoL).</p><p>&#x02022; Dyspnea, including symptom diary scores.</p><p>&#x02022; Exacerbations of COPD.</p><p>&#x02022; Rescue use of salbutamol, a short acting &#x003b2;2 agonist.</p><p>&#x02022; Adverse effects, including tachycardia, hypokalemia, and dry mouth.</p></sec><sec><title>Validity assessment</title><p>The reviewers independently scored the quality of the included trial reports using a five-point scale described by Jadad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which assigns zero to two points each for appropriateness of randomization and double blinding and zero to one point each for reporting on withdrawals and dropouts; low scores are associated with exaggerated estimates of benefit. Concealment of allocation to treatment was also categorized as adequate, inadequate, or unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Data abstraction</title><p>The reviewers independently recorded characteristics of the trials and patients, as well as details of the interventions and outcomes. When outcome data were available only graphically, each reviewer estimated values, and the means of the two estimates were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative data synthesis</title><p>When possible, we calculated mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for binary outcomes for individual trial data using Statistics with Confidence software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], We used intention-to-treat data when available and otherwise end point data for patients completing the trials. Qualitative data were recorded descriptively. We had intended to do a meta-analysis, pooling data on outcomes of interest. This approach is useful when the samples of individual studies are too small for detection of an effect and when results from several trials disagree in magnitude and direction of effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, it is only appropriate when the trials are clinically homogeneous.</p><p>We found that even commonly measured outcomes, such as FEV1, could not be combined by meta-analysis because of differences in how they were reported. For example, in the six trials comparing salmeterol with placebo, FEV1 was reported as a mean change in percent predicted[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], a mean change overall[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], a mean difference between trial arms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], no difference (without data)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], baseline and overall FEV1 (after 24 hrs without medication)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and as an 0 to 12 hour area-under-the-curve (FEV1-AUC) function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] We were not successful in obtaining more data from study authors. We also had concerns about the meta-analysis of data from trials of parallel and crossover design[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and differences in spirometry protocols including allowable medications. Therefore, we decided on a best evidence synthesis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] instead.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Trial Flow</title><p>Both reviewers agreed to tentatively accept 35 of the 58 potentially relevant reports. After further evaluation one reviewer disagreed with including 14 of the 35, which resulted in a moderate level of agreement (Kappa = 0.58; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.78). Discussion revealed that this difference related primarily to confusion surrounding interpretation of one of the criteria for eligibility, and ultimately the other reviewer agreed to reject the disputed reports. The reviewers then independently selected the same nine reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] for final inclusion. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates the study selection process. The updated search strategy identified 24 additional potentially relevant reports. Of these, four reports were independently selected based on the inclusion criteria. There were no disagreements.

The SGRQ has three components: distress due to respiratory symptoms, effects of disturbances on mobility and physical activity, and psychosocial impact of the disease; negative changes represent improvement. Data from 283 patients (95 in the placebo group and 94 in each salmeterol group) were analysed; data for others were excluded because of noncompletion of one or both questionnaires at 16 weeks or inability to meet quality control criteria or both. Salmeterol 50 &#x003bc;g (but not 100 &#x003bc;g) twice daily was associated with significantly greater improvement in mean (standard deviation) SGRQ scores from baseline to endpoint than was placebo: -6.8 (13.2) versus -1.4 (11.7) for total score and -8.0 (17.6) versus 0.0 (15.7) for impact score. No significant differences between placebo and either dose of salmeterol were observed in any of the domains of the SF-36 except for "role-emotional": these scores were significantly worse for recipients of salmeterol 100 &#x003bc;g than for recipients of placebo.</p><p>In the 52 week study).)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], health status was assessed with the SGRQ.

In an 8 week study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] the magnitude of improvement for salmeterol versus placebo recipients rated on an SF-36 scale was significantly greater for the dimensions of "general health" (p = 0.008), "health change" (p = 0.026); physical functioning" (p = 0.008) and "vitality energy and fatigue" (p = 0.008)</p><p>In the trial comparing formoterol, ipratropium, and placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] HRQoL was also evaluated with the disease specific SGRQ.

Since data were not pooled for meta-analysis, we were not able to conduct a sensitivity analysis based on the quality of trial reporting. Accordingly, we cannot comment on the possible influence of quality on the effect size of the outcome measures. Clinical heterogeneity among the trials limited assessment of the overall effect of the interventions. Since we did not perform a meta-analysis, statistical heterogeneity was not an issue.</p><p>We selected reports that met our inclusion criteria, regardless of publication status, language and trial quality using a systematic research methodology; this approach has been shown to minimize potential selection and publication bias and lead to more reliable conclusions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] We made every effort to conduct our review and report its results with the highest rigour.</p><p>A potential limitation of our research is that we did not seek trials comparing long acting &#x003b2;2-agonists marketed outside of Canada (e.g., bambuterol) or those trials comparing long acting &#x003b2;2-agonists to agents other than ipratropium and placebo (e.g., short-acting &#x003b2;2-agonists, methylxanthines). Similarly, we excluded those trials in which the FEV1 response to a bronchodilator was not reported or greater than 15%. Thus, our results may not be generalisable to the greater population of patients who can be currently defined as having COPD[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We plan to include a greater number of comparators and a broader population in an upcoming analysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]</p><p>Our results are similar to those of an earlier review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that identified three placebo controlled trials included in our review, but there are two important differences. In the earlier review FEV1 endpoint data from the placebo and salmeterol groups in two crossover trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] were pooled; the weighted mean differences were not significant. We preferred to analyse net improvement in FEV1 (the difference from baseline to endpoint), as we felt that it more accurately reflected the impact of maintenance therapy. In addition, no trials comparing long acting &#x003b2;2 agonists and ipratropium were available at the time of the earlier review.</p><p>Another review has recently been published.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] However, these authors restricted their search to MEDLINE and failed to identify a clinical trial comparing formoterol with ipratropium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] As a consequence, the evidence describing the use of formoterol versus ipratropium is limited to a single trial.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] In contrast, we opted to exclude this trial after identifying two trials because roughly 40% of patients exhibited partial reversibility of FEV1 (15% to 80%) to an inhaled dose of 200 mcg salbutamol at baseline. We are in agreement with the authors' summary of the evidence surrounding salmeterol versus ipratropium.</p><p>We believe our findings are in accord with current guidelines, such as the GOLD guidelines, that suggest bronchodilators should be prescribed according to individual patient responses. However, policymakers with limited health service resources need to be aware of an identifiable sub-population of patients with poorly reversible COPD for which long acting &#x003b2;2-agonists may result in reduced efficiency (cost-effectiveness).</p><p>Our research also suggests clinical investigators of COPD trials should stratify trial participants into groups for which outcomes may consistently differ.

Outcome information from patients with poor reversibility was also analyzed in an abstract[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] of an excluded trial but not in the published report.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] We were unable to ascertain sufficient details surrounding this analysis to add it to our findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In terms of clinical outcomes and safety, we could not find convincing evidence that salmeterol and formoterol have demonstrated advantages to ipratropium, a less expensive drug, for patients with stable COPD and poor reversibility. Compared to placebo, we found evidence of reduced rescue inhaler usage and improved spirometric outcomes without a significant impact on quality of life or exercise capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Donald Husereau, Vijay Shukla, Michel Boucher, and Shaila Mensinkai have no competing interests to declare.
