The nucleus accumbens core (AcbC), part of the ventral striatum, is required for normal preference for a large, delayed reward over a small, immediate reward (self-controlled choice) in rats, but the reason for this is unclear. We investigated the role of the AcbC in learning a free-operant instrumental response using delayed reinforcement, performance of a previously-learned response for delayed reinforcement, and assessment of the relative magnitudes of two different rewards.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Groups of rats with excitotoxic or sham lesions of the AcbC acquired an instrumental response with different delays (0, 10, or 20 s) between the lever-press response and reinforcer delivery. A second (inactive) lever was also present, but responding on it was never reinforced. As expected, the delays retarded learning in normal rats. AcbC lesions did not hinder learning in the absence of delays, but AcbC-lesioned rats were impaired in learning when there was a delay, relative to sham-operated controls. All groups eventually acquired the response and discriminated the active lever from the inactive lever to some degree. Rats were subsequently trained to discriminate reinforcers of different magnitudes. AcbC-lesioned rats were more sensitive to differences in reinforcer magnitude than sham-operated controls, suggesting that the deficit in self-controlled choice previously observed in such rats was a consequence of reduced preference for delayed rewards relative to immediate rewards, not of reduced preference for large rewards relative to small rewards. AcbC lesions also impaired the performance of a previously-learned instrumental response in a delay-dependent fashion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results demonstrate that the AcbC contributes to instrumental learning and performance by bridging delays between subjects' actions and the ensuing outcomes that reinforce behaviour.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Animals learn to control their environment through instrumental (operant) conditioning. When an animal acts to obtain reward or reinforcement, there is often a delay between its action and the outcome; thus, animals must learn instrumental action-outcome contingencies using delayed reinforcement. Although such delays impair learning, animals can nevertheless bridge substantial delays to acquire instrumental responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Little is known of the neural basis of this process. However, abnormalities in learning from delayed reinforcement may be of considerable clinical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Impulsivity is part of the syndrome of many psychiatric disorders, including mania, drug addiction, antisocial personality disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Impulsive choice, one aspect of impulsivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], is exemplified by the tendency to choose small rewards that are available immediately instead of larger rewards that are only available after a delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and may reflect dysfunction of reinforcement learning systems mediating the effects of delayed rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The nucleus accumbens (Acb) responds to anticipated rewards in humans, other primates, and rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and is innervated by dopamine (DA) neurons that respond to errors in reward prediction in a manner appropriate for a teaching signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The Acb may therefore represent a reinforcement learning system specialized for learning with delayed reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. If this is the case, then damage to the Acb should not interfere with reinforcement learning in all circumstances, but should produce selective impairments in learning when reinforcement is delayed. This prediction has not previously been tested. However, lesions of the AcbC cause rats to prefer small immediate rewards (a single food pellet delivered immediately) to large delayed rewards (four pellets delivered after a delay); that is, AcbC-lesioned rats exhibit impulsive choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The reason for this is not clear. It might be that AcbC-lesioned rats exhibit steeper temporal discounting, such that the subjective utility (value) of future rewards declines more rapidly than normal as the reward is progressively delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It might also be that AcbC-lesioned rats are less good at representing the contingency between actions and their outcomes when the outcomes are delayed, so that they choose impulsively because they are less certain or less aware that their choosing the delayed reward does in fact lead to that reward being delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Both explanations would reflect a problem in dealing with delayed reinforcement in AcbC-lesioned rats. However, there might be a simpler explanation for the impulsive choice exhibited by AcbC-lesioned rats: they might perceive the size (magnitude) of rewards differently. For example, if they do not perceive the delayed reward to be as large, relative to the immediate reward, as normal rats did, then they might choose impulsively despite processing the delays to reward normally, simply because the delayed reinforcer is not subjectively large enough to compensate for the normal effects of the delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>To investigate whether the AcbC is a reinforcement learning system specialized for delayed reinforcement, we first determined the ability of AcbC-lesioned rats to detect instrumental contingencies across a delay. The ability of AcbC-lesioned rats to acquire instrumental responding with delayed reinforcement was compared to that of sham-operated controls; each subject was allowed to respond freely on two levers, one of which produced reinforcement after a delay of 0, 10, or 20 s (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We report that AcbC lesions only retarded instrumental learning when reinforcement was delayed, demonstrating a role for the AcbC in bridging action-outcome delays during learning. Subsequently, to establish whether AcbC-lesioned rats perceive reward magnitude abnormally, we assessed these subjects' sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude by measuring their relative preference for two different reinforcers using concurrent interval schedules of reinforcement. We report that reinforcer magnitude discrimination in AcbC-lesioned rats in this task was at least as good as in sham-operated controls, consistent with previous evidence of reinforcer magnitude discrimination following lesions of the whole Acb e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that the impulsive choice seen in AcbC-lesioned rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] is due to a problem in processing delayed reward, not in processing the magnitudes of the reward alternatives. Finally, to establish whether the AcbC is required for the performance of an instrumental response for delayed reinforcement, as well as for the learning of such a response, we trained na&#x000ef;ve rats to respond for delayed reinforcement (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) before destroying the AcbC. We report that such lesions also impaired performance of a previously-learned instrumental response only when reinforcement was delayed, indicating that the AcbC makes an enduring contribution to bridging delays between subjects' actions and the ensuing outcomes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Task schematic: free-operant instrumental responding on a fixed-ratio-1 (FR-1) schedule with delayed reinforcement </bold>Subjects are offered two levers; one (the active lever) delivers a single food pellet for every press (an FR-1 schedule) and the other (the inactive lever) has no programmed consequence. Food can either be delivered immediately <bold>(a) </bold>or after a delay <bold>(b) </bold>following responses on the active lever. The levers remain available throughout the session (hence, free-operant responding: animals are free to perform the operant at any time). Events of interest are lever presses, delivery of food pellets, and collection of food by the rat (when it pokes its nose into the food alcove following food delivery). To obtain food, the hungry rat must discriminate the active from the inactive lever, which is more difficult when the outcome is delayed. In these examples, the rat's response patterns (active and inactive lever presses, and collection of food) are fictional, while food delivery is contingent upon active lever pressing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-6-9-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In Experiment 1, rats received excitotoxic lesions of the AcbC or sham lesions, and were then tested on an instrumental free-operant acquisition task with delayed reinforcement (Experiment 1A; see Methods) and subsequently a reinforcer magnitude discrimination task (Experiment 1B).

In Experiment 2, one rat spontaneously fell ill with a colonic volvulus during preoperative training and was killed, and there were three postoperative deaths.

Lesions of the AcbC did not impair instrumental learning when the reinforcer was delivered immediately, but substantially impaired learning with delayed reinforcement, indicating that the AcbC 'bridges' action-outcome delays during learning. Lesions made after learning also impaired performance of the instrumental response in a delay-dependent fashion, indicating that the AcbC also contributes to the performance of actions for delayed reinforcement. Finally, the lesions did not impair the perception of relative reward magnitude as assessed by responding on identical concurrent interval schedules for reinforcers of different magnitude, suggesting that the impulsive choice previously exhibited by AcbC-lesioned rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] is attributable to deficits in dealing with delays to reinforcement.</p><sec><title>Effect of delays on instrumental learning in normal animals</title><p>Delays have long been known to retard instrumental learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Despite this, normal rats have been shown to acquire free-operant responding with programmed response-reinforcer delays of up to 32 s, or even 64 s if the subjects are pre-exposed to the learning environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Delays do reduce the asymptotic level of responding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], though the reason for this phenomenon is not clear. It may be that when subjects learn a response with a substantial response-reinforcer delay, they never succeed in representing the instrumental action-outcome contingency fully. Alternatively, they may value the delayed reinforcer slightly less; finally, the delay may also retard the acquisition of a procedural stimulus-response habit and this might account for the decrease in asymptotic responding. It is not presently known to what degree responses acquired with a response-reinforcer delay are governed by declarative processes (the action-outcome contingency plus a representation of the instrumental incentive value of the outcome) or procedural mechanisms (stimulus-response habits), both of which are known to influence instrumental responding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; it is similarly not known whether the balance of these two controlling mechanisms differs from that governing responses learned without such a delay.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of AcbC lesions on instrumental learning and performance with or without delays</title><p>In the absence of response-reinforcer delays, AcbC-lesioned rats acquired an instrumental response normally, responding even more than sham-operated controls. In contrast, blockade of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors in the AcbC has been shown to retard instrumental learning for food under a variable-ratio-2 (VR-2) schedule [in which <italic>P</italic>(reinforcer | response) &#x02245; 0.5] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], as has inhibition or over-stimulation of cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA) within the Acb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Concurrent blockade of NMDA and DA D1 receptors in the AcbC synergistically prevents learning of a VR-2 schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Once the response has been learned, subsequent performance on this schedule is not impaired by NMDA receptor blockade within the AcbC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, infusion of a PKA inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] or a protein synthesis inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] into the AcbC <italic>after </italic>instrumental training sessions impairs subsequent performance, implying that PKA activity and protein synthesis in the AcbC contribute to the consolidation of instrumental behaviour. Thus, manipulation of Acb neurotransmission can affect instrumental learning. However, it is also clear that excitotoxic destruction of the AcbC or even the entire Acb does not impair simple instrumental conditioning to any substantial degree. Rats with Acb or AcbC lesions acquire lever-press responses on sequences of random ratio schedules [in which <italic>P</italic>(reinforcer | response) typically declines from around 1 to 0.05 over training] at near-normal levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In such ratio schedules, where several responses are required to obtain reinforcement, there is no delay between the final response and reinforcement, but there are delays between earlier responses and eventual reinforcement. It is therefore of interest that when differences between AcbC-lesioned rats and shams have been observed, AcbC-lesioned animals have been found to respond somewhat less than shams on such schedules late in training, when the ratio requirement is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], consistent with our present results. However, lesioned rats are fully sensitive to changes in the instrumental contingency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Our present results indicate that when AcbC-lesioned rats are exposed to a FR-1 schedule for food [<italic>P</italic>(reinforcer | response) = 1] in the absence of response-reinforcer delays, they acquire the response at normal rates.</p><p>In contrast, when a delay was imposed between responding and reinforcement, AcbC-lesioned rats were impaired relative to sham-operated controls, in a systematic and delay-dependent fashion. The observation that learning was not affected at zero delay rules out a number of explanations of this effect. For example, it cannot be that AcbC-lesioned rats are in some way less motivated for the food <italic>per se</italic>, since they responded normally (in fact, more than shams) when the food was not delayed. Thus although the Acb and its dopaminergic innervation are clearly very important in motivating behaviour e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], this is not on its own a sufficient explanation for the present results. An explanation in terms of a rate-dependent impairment is also not tenable, since the AcbC-lesioned rats were capable (in the zero-delay condition) of responding at a level greater than they exhibited in the non-zero-delay conditions. Depletion of Acb DA also impairs rats' ability to work on high-effort schedules, where many, or very forceful, responses are required to obtain a given amount of food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, in the present experiments the ratio requirement (one response per reinforcer) and the force required per press were both held constant across delays, so this effect cannot explain the present results. Similarly, although AcbC lesions are known to impair the control over behaviour by Pavlovian conditioned stimuli e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], there was no Pavlovian stimulus that was differentially associated with delayed as opposed to immediate reinforcement in this task, so this cannot explain the present results.</p><p>Our results also indicated that when there were programmed delays to reinforcement, AcbC-lesioned animals experienced longer response-reinforcer collection delays, partly due to their failure to collect the reinforcer as promptly as shams. These additional experienced delays probably retarded learning. However, in addition to this effect, there was a further deficit exhibited by AcbC-lesioned rats: even allowing for the longer response-collection delays that they experienced, their instrumental learning was impaired more by delays than that of sham-operated controls. Deficits in learning with delayed reinforcement may account for some of the variability in the effect of AcbC lesions or local pharmacological manipulations on instrumental learning across different schedules.</p><p>The fact that pre-exposure to the context improves instrumental learning in normal rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] suggests one possible mechanism by which AcbC lesions might retard learning when delays are present. When a reinforcer arrives, it may be associated either with a preceding response, or with the context. Therefore, in normal animals, pre-exposure to the context may retard the formation of context-reinforcer associations by latent inhibition, or it might serve to retard the formation of associations between irrelevant behaviours and reinforcement. Similarly, non-reinforced exposure to the context forces the subjects to experience a zero-response, zero-reinforcer situation, i.e. <italic>P</italic>(<italic>outcome </italic>| <italic>no action</italic>) = 0. When they are then exposed to the instrumental contingency, such that <italic>P</italic>(<italic>outcome </italic>| <italic>action</italic>) &#x0003e; 0, this prior experience may enhance their ability to detect the instrumental contingency &#x00394;<italic>P </italic>= <italic>P</italic>(<italic>outcome </italic>| <italic>action</italic>) - <italic>P</italic>(<italic>outcome </italic>| <italic>no action</italic>). In one aversive Pavlovian conditioning procedure in which a conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with electric shock, AcbC lesions have been shown to impair conditioning to discrete CSs, but simultaneously to enhance conditioning to contextual (background) CSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], though not all behavioural paradigms show this effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. It is therefore possible that enhanced formation of context-reinforcer associations may explain the retardation of response-reinforcer learning in AcbC-lesioned rats in the presence of delays.</p><p>The instrumental task used requires animals either to associate their response with the delayed food outcome (an action-outcome association that can be used for goal-directed behaviour), or to strengthen a stimulus-response association (habit) when the reinforcer eventually arrives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Both mechanisms require the animal to maintain a representation of their past action so it can be reinforced (as a habit) or associated with food when the food finally arrives. This mnemonic requirement is not obviated even if the animal learns to predict the arrival of food using discriminative stimuli, and uses these stimuli to reinforce its responding (conditioned reinforcement): in either case, since the action precedes reinforcement, some trace of past actions or stimuli must persist to be affected by the eventual delivery of food.</p><p>A delay-dependent impairment was also seen when AcbC lesions were made after training. This indicates that the AcbC does not only contribute to the learning of a response when there is an action-outcome delay: it also contributes to the performance of a previously-learned response. Again, AcbC-lesioned rats were only impaired when that previously-learned response was for delayed (and not immediate) reinforcement. Of course, learning of an instrumental response depends upon the animal being able to perform that response; preventing an animal from pressing a lever (a performance deficit) would clearly impair its ability to learn an instrumental response on that lever to obtain food. In the present set of experiments, it is clear that AcbC-lesioned rats were just as able to perform the response itself (to press the active lever and to discriminate it physically from the inactive lever) as controls, as shown by their normal performance in the zero-delay condition, so it is not clear whether the delay-dependent impairments in learning and performance can be attributed to the same process. Again, since responding was unaffected in the zero-delay condition, many alternative interpretations (such as a lack of motivation to work for the food) are ruled out. It may be that AcbC-lesioned rats are impaired at representing a declarative instrumental action-outcome contingency when the outcome is delayed, or in forming or executing a procedural stimulus-response habit when the reinforcing event does not follow the response immediately. It may also be that they represent the action-outcome contingency normally but value the food less because it is delayed, and that this affects responding in a free-operant situation even though there is no alternative reinforcer available.</p></sec><sec><title>Discrimination of reinforcer magnitude in AcbC-lesioned rats</title><p>Excitotoxic lesions of the whole Acb do not prevent rats from detecting changes in reward value (induced either by altering the concentration of a sucrose reward or by changing the deprivational state of the subject) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Such lesions also do not impair rats' ability to respond faster when environmental cues predict the availability of larger rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and nor does inactivation of the Acb with local anaesthetic or blockade of AMPA glutamate receptors in the Acb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]; the effects of intra-Acb NMDA receptor antagonists have varied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. AcbC-lesioned rats can still discriminate large from small rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Similarly, DA depletion of the Acb does not affect the ability to discriminate large from small reinforcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], and systemic DA antagonists do not affect the perceived quantity of food as assessed in a psychophysical procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Our study extends these findings by demonstrating that excitotoxic AcbC lesions do not impair rats' ability to allocate their responses across two schedules in proportion to the experienced reinforcement rate, even when the two schedules are identical except in the magnitude of the reinforcements they provide, thus demonstrating their sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude is quantitatively no worse than shams'. In this experiment, there was substantial undermatching, but this is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]; differential cues signalling the two rewards might have improved matching but were not used in the present experiments since it is known that AcbC lesions can themselves affect rats' sensitivity to cues signalling reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Given that AcbC-lesioned subjects showed a reduced probability of switching between two identical RI schedules, it may be the case that an enhanced sensitivity to the COD accounts for the better matching exhibited by the AcbC-lesioned rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Alternatively, the lesion may have enhanced reinforcer magnitude discrimination or improved the process by which behaviour allocation is matched to environmental contingencies. In summary, the present results suggest that AcbC damage leads to pathological impulsive choice (preferring a small, immediate reinforcer to a large, delayed reinforcer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] not through any relative lack of value of large reinforcers, but through a specific deficit in responding for delayed reinforcement.</p></sec><sec><title>Contribution of the AcbC to reinforcement learning</title><p>The term 'reinforcement learning' simply means learning to act on the basis of reinforcement received; it is a term used in artificial intelligence research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] that does not specify the mechanism of such learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Our present results indicate that the AcbC is a reinforcement learning structure that is critical for instrumental conditioning when outcomes are delayed, consistent with electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging evidence indicating that the ventral striatum responds to recent past actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and to predicted future rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and with computational models suggesting a role for the striatum in predicting future primary reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, when reward is certain and delivered immediately, the AcbC is not necessary for the acquisition of instrumental responding. The delay-dependent role of the AcbC indicates that it plays a role in allowing actions to be reinforced by bridging action-outcome delays through a representation of past acts or future rewards. Acb lesions have also produced delay-dependent impairments in a delayed-matching-to-position task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]; their effects on the delayed-matching-to-sample paradigm have also been studied, but a more profound and delay-independent deficit was observed, likely due to differences in the specific task used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Finally, the AcbC is not alone in containing neurons that respond to past actions and future rewards. The dorsal striatum is another such structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]; expression of stimulus-response habits requires the dorsal striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], and the rate at which rats learn an arbitrary response that delivers electrical stimulation to the substantia nigra is correlated with the degree of potentiation of synapses made by cortical afferents onto striatal neurons, a potentiation that requires DA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. The prelimbic area of rat prefrontal cortex is important for the detection of instrumental contingencies and contributes to goal-directed, rather than habitual, action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. Similarly, the orbitofrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala encode reinforcement information and project to the AcbC, and lesions of these structures can produce impulsive choice see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>].

However, AcbC lesions impair rats' ability to learn the same instrumental response when the outcome is delayed. The lesions also impair performance of an instrumental response that was learned preoperatively, but again only when response-reinforcer delays were present. These results suggest that the AcbC makes a specific contribution to reinforcement learning and instrumental performance when reinforcing outcomes do not arrive immediately but are delayed. AcbC dysfunction, which is known to promote impulsive choice, appears to cause rats to be temporally short-sighted, learning preferentially about the proximal consequences of their actions and preferring immediate over delayed rewards.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview of experiments</title><sec><title>Experiment 1A: Effects of AcbC lesions on acquisition of instrumental responding with delayed reinforcement</title><p>Fifty na&#x000ef;ve rats received excitotoxic lesions of the AcbC (<italic>n </italic>= 26) or sham lesions (<italic>n </italic>= 24).

They were again offered two levers, but this time both levers delivered reinforcement on a variable-interval schedule, which provides reinforcement in an intermittent and temporally unpredictable fashion. Reinforcers consisted of either 1 or 4 sucrose pellets. Over sessions, the levers' roles changed so that the ratio of the sizes of the reinforcers available on the two levers was 4:1, 1:1, or 1:4. Subjects' responding was measured to establish their ability to judge the relative differences in reinforcer magnitudes and to allocate their responses according to the matching law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Finally, they were killed and perfused for histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 2: Effects of AcbC lesions on performance of a previously-learned instrumental response for delayed reinforcement</title><p>A further 48 na&#x000ef;ve rats were trained to acquire an instrumental response as before, with delays to reinforcement of 0 s (<italic>n </italic>= 16), 10 s (<italic>n </italic>= 16), or 20 s (<italic>n </italic>= 16). One rat spontaneously fell ill with a colonic volvulus and was killed. Once the subjects had been trained for 14 sessions, they were allocated to receive either AcbC lesions or sham surgery (0 s: 8 AcbC, 7 sham; 10 s: 8 AcbC, 8 sham; 20 s: 8 AcbC, 8 sham). Sham and AcbC groups were matched for performance preoperatively: within each delay condition, rats were ranked by their rates of responding on the active lever at the end of training, and rats with equivalent levels of performance were randomized to receive sham or AcbC lesion surgery. They were then retested postoperatively on the same task for a further 18 sessions (giving 32 sessions in total), with each rat experiencing the same delay as it had preoperatively. These rats then had their locomotor activity assessed, and were killed and perfused for histology.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Subjects and housing conditions</title><p>Subjects were male Lister hooded rats (Harlan-Olac UK Ltd) housed in a temperature-controlled room (minimum 22&#x000b0;C) under a 12:12 h reversed light-dark cycle (lights off 07:30 to 19:30). Subjects were approximately 15 weeks old on arrival at the laboratory and were given a minimum of a week to acclimatize, with free access to food, before experiments began. Experiments took place between 09:00 and 21:00, with individual subjects being tested at a consistent time of day. Subjects had free access to water. During behavioural testing, they were maintained at 85&#x02013;90% of their free-feeding mass using a restricted feeding regimen. Feeding occurred in the home cages at the end of the experimental day. All procedures were subject to UK Home Office approval (Project Licences PPL 80/1324 and 80/1767) under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p></sec><sec><title>Excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens core</title><p>Subjects were anaesthetized with Avertin (2% w/v 2,2,2-tribromoethanol, 1% w/v 2-methylbutan-2-ol, and 8% v/v ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline, sterilized by filtration, 10 ml/kg i.p.) and placed in a Kopf or Stoelting stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, California, USA; Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, Illinois, USA) fitted with atraumatic ear bars. The skull was exposed and a dental drill was used to remove the bone directly above the injection and cannulation sites. The dura mater was broken with the tip of a hypodermic needle, avoiding damage to underlying venous sinuses. Excitotoxic lesions of the AcbC were made by injecting 0.5 &#x003bc;l of 0.09 M quinolinic acid (Sigma, UK) through a glass micropipette at coordinates 1.2 mm anterior to bregma, &#x000b1; 1.8 mm from the midline, and 7.1 mm below the skull surface at bregma; the incisor bar was 3.3 mm below the interaural line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. The toxin had been dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (composition 0.07 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.028 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>in double-distilled water, sterilized by filtration) and adjusted with NaOH to a final pH of 7.2&#x02013;7.4. Toxin was injected over 3 min and the micropipette was left in place for 2 min following injections. Sham lesions were made in the same manner except that vehicle was infused. At the end of the operation, animals were given 15 ml/kg of sterile 5% w/v glucose, 0.9% w/v sodium chloride intraperitoneally. They were given a week to recover, with free access to food, and were handled regularly. Any instances of postoperative constipation were treated with liquid paraffin orally and rectally. At the end of this period, food restriction commenced or was resumed.</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioural apparatus</title><p>Behavioural testing was conducted in one of two types of operant chamber of identical configuration (from Med Associates Inc, Georgia, Vermont, USA, or Paul Fray Ltd, Cambridge, UK). Each chamber was fitted with a 2.8 W overhead house light and two retractable levers on either side of an alcove fitted with an infrared photodiode to detect head entry. Sucrose pellets (45 mg, Rodent Diet Formula P, Noyes, Lancaster, New Hampshire, USA) could be delivered into the alcove. The chambers were enclosed within sound-attenuating boxes fitted with fans to provide air circulation. The apparatus was controlled by software written by RNC in C++ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>] using the Whisker control system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Instrumental conditioning with delayed reinforcement</title><p>A variety of free-operant schedules may be used to assess instrumental acquisition with delayed reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We used the simplest possible free-operant schedule: each response scheduled a reinforcer after the programmed delay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In such a schedule, if the subject responds during the delay, the experienced response-reinforcer delay will not match the programmed delay (as the second response is temporally close to the first reinforcer). However, this schedule has the advantage that the response-reinforcer contingency is constant (every response does in fact cause the delivery of reinforcement) and the reinforcement rate is not constrained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. So that responding could be attributed to the instrumental response-reinforcer contingency, rather than the effects of general activity or reinforcement itself, responding on the active lever was compared to responding on a control lever that had no programmed consequence. Different groups of lesioned and sham-operated subjects were trained using different delays; the delay was consistent for every subject. Delays of 0, 10, and 20 s were used.</p><p>Alternative free-operant schedules for this purpose exist, such as one in which the first response sets up reinforcement, and a subsequent response made before the reinforcer is delivered postpones reinforcement, in order to keep the delay between the last response and the reinforcer constant (known as a tandem fixed-ratio-1 differential-reinforcement-of-other-behaviour or FR-1-DRO schedule). However, the tandem FR-1-DRO schedule constrains the maximum rate of reinforcement, which also decreases as the delay being used increases. Furthermore, it does not hold constant the probability of reinforcement given a response, and it introduces two opposing contingencies: some responses make reinforcement more likely, while others (those during the delay) make it less likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, we did not use this schedule. Similarly, the acquisition of instrumental responding with delayed reinforcement may be assessed with discrete-trial tasks. For example, two levers could be presented in trials occurring at fixed intervals, the levers could be retracted when a response had been made, and responding on one lever could be reinforced after a delay, taking care to avoid a differential Pavlovian contingency between presentation or retraction of one lever and reinforcement, since responding might then be due to Pavlovian conditioning autoshaping; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>] rather than the instrumental contingency. However, this discrete-trial schedule would also divide up the session explicitly into response-food delays and food-response (intertrial) times, a process that might aid learning and/or be affected by the lesion. Furthermore, there is prior evidence that AcbC lesions impair rats' ability to choose a delayed reward over an immediate reward in the discrete-trial situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, to address the more general question of whether the AcbC is required to acquire instrumental responding with delayed reinforcement, we chose instead to use a free-operant schedule; this seemed to us to mimic best the real-life problem of relating actions to their outcomes with no explicit demarcation of when a response had been made or when a response was permissible.</p><p>Immediately after subjects were placed in the operant chamber, the sessions began. The houselight was illuminated, and remained on for each 30-min session. Two levers were extended into the chamber. All lever responses were first 'debounced' to 10 ms (i.e. if a response occurred within 10 ms of a previous valid response it was attributed to mechanical bounce and ignored). Other than this, all lever presses and nosepokes into the food alcove were recorded. Responding on the left (active) lever caused a single pellet to be delivered following a delay, under a fixed-ratio-1 (FR-1) schedule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). To attribute acquisition of a lever-press response to the instrumental contingency, it is also necessary to control for the effects of reinforcer delivery itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; therefore, responding on the active lever was compared to responding on the right (inactive) lever, which had no programmed consequence. To minimize any potential contribution of conditioned reinforcement to the task, no explicit signals were associated with pellet delivery other than the noise of the pellet dispenser apparatus.</p></sec><sec><title>Locomotor activity in a novel environment</title><p>Since general activity levels might influence instrumental responding, locomotor activity was also measured, using wire mesh cages, 25 (W) &#x000d7; 40 (D) &#x000d7; 18 (H) cm, equipped with two horizontal photocell beams situated 1 cm from the floor that enabled movements along the long axis of the cage to be registered. Subjects were placed in these cages, which were initially unfamiliar to them, and their activity was recorded for 2 h. All animals were tested in the food-deprived state. Locomotor hyperactivity and reduced weight gain have previously been part of the phenotype of AcbC-lesioned rats, though without alterations in the consumption of the reinforcer used in the present experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Matching of response distribution to reinforcer magnitude distribution on a concurrent schedule</title><p>Subjects were trained in 30-min sessions to respond on both levers separately under interval schedules of reinforcement. The two levers were designated A and B; these were counterbalanced left/right (thus, for half the subjects in each group, lever A was the lever reinforced previously in the delay task; for the other half, it was the lever previously unreinforced). As before, responses were debounced to 10 ms. Training and testing proceeded according to Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Random-interval-<italic>x</italic>-second (RI-<italic>x</italic>) schedules were implemented by having a clock tick once a second; each tick set up reinforcement with a probability <italic>p </italic>= 1/<italic>x</italic>. Once reinforcement had been set up for a schedule, the next response caused reinforcement to be delivered. Multiple pellets were delivered 0.5 s apart. For concurrent RI schedules, a 2 s changeover delay (COD) was imposed to discourage frequent switching between schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. The COD was implemented as follows: if a subject pressed lever B, it could only be reinforced if more than 2 s had elapsed since it last pressed lever A (and vice versa). The RI schedules could still set up reinforcement during the COD, but the subject could not earn that reinforcement until the COD had elapsed.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology</title><p>Rats were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (200 mg/ml, minimum of 1.5 ml i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Their brains were removed and postfixed in paraformaldehyde before being dehydrated in 20% sucrose for cryoprotection. The brains were sectioned coronally at 60 &#x003bc;m thickness on a freezing microtome and every third section mounted on chromium potassium sulphate/gelatin-coated glass microscope slides and allowed to dry. Sections were passed through a series of ethanol solutions of descending concentration (3 minutes in each of 100%, 95%, and 70% v/v ethanol in water) and stained for ~5 min with cresyl violet. The stain comprises 0.05% w/v aqueous cresyl violet (Raymond A. Lamb Ltd, Eastbourne, UK), 2 mM acetic acid, and 5 mM formic acid in water. Following staining, sections were rinsed in water and 70% ethanol before being differentiated in 95% ethanol. Finally, they were dehydrated and delipidated in 100% ethanol and Histoclear (National Diagnostics, UK) before being cover-slipped using DePeX mounting medium (BDH, UK) and allowed to dry. The sections were used to verify cannula and lesion placement and assess the extent of lesion-induced neuronal loss. Lesions were detectable as the absence of visible neurons (cell bodies of the order of 100 &#x003bc;m in diameter with a characteristic shape and appearance), often associated with a degree of tissue collapse (sometimes with consequent ventricular expansion when the lesion was adjacent to a ventricle) and gliosis (visible as the presence of smaller, densely-staining cells).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data collected by the chamber control programs were imported into a relational database (Microsoft Access 97) for case selection and analysed with SPSS 11.
