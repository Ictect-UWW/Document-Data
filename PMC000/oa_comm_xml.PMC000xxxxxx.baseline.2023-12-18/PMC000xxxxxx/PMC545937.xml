In 2003, 672,718 people were diagnosed with an STD in England, and around one third of those cases were diagnosed in London.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using GeoReveal v1.1 for Windows, we produced Web-based interactive choropleth maps of diagnoses of STDs by Primary Care Trust (PCT) in London for the years from 1997 to 2003 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://healthcybermap.org/PCT/STDs/"/>. These maps are in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format and require a freely available Adobe SVG browser plug-in to be displayed. They are based on data obtained from the House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 15 October 2004. They show steadily rising rates of STDs in London over the covered seven-year period. Also, one can clearly see on the maps that PCTs located in central London had the highest numbers of STD diagnoses throughout the mapped seven years. A companion bar chart allows users to instantly compare the STD figure of a given PCT for a given year against the average figure for all 25 mapped PCTs for the same year, and also compare those figures across all seven years. The maps offer users a rich set of useful features and functions, including the ability to change the classification method in use, the number of ranges in the map, and the colour theme, among others.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Wizard-driven tools like GeoReveal have made it very easy to transform complex raw data into valuable decision support information products (interactive Web maps) in very little time and without requiring much expertise. The resultant interactive maps have the potential of further supporting health planners and decision makers in their planning and management tasks by allowing them to graphically interrogate data, instantly spot trends, and make quick and effective visual comparisons of geographically differentiated phenomena between different geographical areas and over time.</p><p>SVG makes an ideal format for such maps. SVG is a World Wide Web Consortium non-proprietary, XML-based vector graphics format, and is an extremely powerful alternative to Macromedia<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Flash and bitmap graphics.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have become a major public health concern in the UK during recent years. The rates of STDs in England have been rising steadily since the mid 1990s. In 2003, the number of STDs in England rose by 4% compared to 2002. Overall, 672,718 people were diagnosed with an STD in England in 2003, and around one third of those cases were diagnosed in the London area alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 15 October 2004 included an answer by Melanie Johnson MP, Minister for Public Health at the Department of Health, to a question by Sarah Teather MP on "how many cases of diagnosed STDs there were in each Primary Care Trust (PCT) in London in each year since 1997". The answer was provided in the form of a long table showing the figures for 25 PCTs in London (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> &#x02013; [<xref ref-type="bibr"

A 'Number of Colours' list allows users to select how many classes or ranges are used in the choropleth map (two to five ranges). Using the 'Select Map Topic' list, users can select the topic that is shown on the main map (a year from 1997 to 2003). Finally, users can select from the 'Colour of Theme' list the colour theme that is used in the main map (orange, green, or blue).</p><p>Map zooming, panning, MapTips (displaying PCT names), and a dynamic legend are available.

These maps are in SVG format and require a freely available Adobe SVG browser plug-in to be displayed. They are based on data obtained from the House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 15 October 2004. They show steadily rising rates of STDs in London over the covered seven-year period. Also, one can clearly see on the maps that PCTs located in central London had the highest numbers of STD diagnoses throughout the mapped seven years. A companion bar chart allows users to instantly compare the STD figure of a given PCT for a given year against the average figure for all 25 mapped PCTs for the same year, and also compare those figures across all seven years. The maps offer users a rich set of useful features and functions, including the ability to change the classification method in use, the number of ranges in the map, and the colour theme, among others.</p><p>We also presented a quick review of some of the tools available today for creating interactive vector graphics maps from desktop GIS projects.</p><p>Wizard-driven tools like GeoReveal have made it very easy to transform complex raw data into valuable decision support information products (interactive Web maps) in very little time and without requiring much expertise. The resultant interactive maps have the potential of further supporting health planners and decision makers in their planning and management tasks by allowing them to graphically interrogate data, instantly spot trends, and make quick and effective visual comparisons of geographically differentiated phenomena between different geographical areas and over time.</p><p>SVG makes an ideal format for such maps. SVG is a W3C non-proprietary, XML-based vector graphics format, and is an extremely powerful alternative to Macromedia<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Flash and bitmap graphics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used GeoReveal v1.1 for Windows to create the interactive SVG maps described in this paper. GeoReveal runs under Windows 98/NT/2000/XP and requires Microsoft<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>.NET framework v1.1 to be installed on the production machine.</p><p>We started by extracting London PCT boundaries from a larger data set of all England (2001 Census PCT &#x02013; post April 2002 change), which is the copyright of the Crown/Ordnance Survey <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/"/>, and is freely available in both ArcView and MapInfo formats to the UK academic community from EDINA UKBORDERS service with the support of the ESRC and JISC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://edina.ac.uk/ukborders/"/>. We also prepared a spreadsheet containing data about the number of STDs recorded in each London PCT between 1997 and 2003 using data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The two files were merged using MapInfo Professional v7.5 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mapinfo.com/"/>, creating a MapInfo .TAB file. This file was exported to MID/MIF format, the format that files need to be in, in order to be used by GeoReveal.</p><p>We created our presentation (the interactive SVG Web maps) using the GeoReveal Wizard; an eight-step process that allows users to create a fully interactive SVG page.</p><sec><title>Introduction: setting the output directory</title><p>The first Wizard dialog that must be completed is the 'Introduction' dialog, which is used to specify the directory to which the final GeoReveal output files will be saved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Screenshot of the 'Introduction' dialog. </bold>Screenshot of the 'Introduction' dialog in GeoReveal Wizard.
