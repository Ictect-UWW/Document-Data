<article-title>Genome-Wide Survey of Cohesin: A Molecular Guardian of Genomic Fidelity</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>The recruitment of cohesins to pericentric chromatin in some organisms appears to require heterochromatin associated with repetitive DNA. However, neocentromeres and budding yeast centromeres lack flanking repetitive DNA, indicating that cohesin recruitment occurs through an alternative pathway. Here, we demonstrate that all budding yeast chromosomes assemble cohesin domains that extend over 20&#x02013;50 kb of unique pericentric sequences flanking the conserved 120-bp centromeric DNA. The assembly of these cohesin domains requires the presence of a functional kinetochore in every cell cycle. A similar enhancement of cohesin binding was also observed in regions flanking an ectopic centromere. At both endogenous and ectopic locations, the centromeric enhancer amplified the inherent levels of cohesin binding that are unique to each region. Thus, kinetochores are enhancers of cohesin association that act over tens of kilobases to assemble pericentric cohesin domains. These domains are larger than the pericentric regions stretched by microtubule attachments, and thus are likely to counter microtubule-dependent forces. Kinetochores mediate two essential segregation functions: chromosome movement through microtubule attachment and biorientation of sister chromatids through the recruitment of high levels of cohesin to pericentric regions. We suggest that the coordination of chromosome movement and biorientation makes the kinetochore an autonomous segregation unit.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Kinetochores mediate chromosome movement through microtubule attachment and biorientation of sister chromatids through the recruitment of high levels of cohesin to pericentric regions</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proper segregation of replicated chromosomes, or sister chromatids, to daughter cells during mitosis requires that sister chromatids establish stable attachments to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles, known as chromosome biorientation, and that sister chromatids move to opposite poles of the cell during anaphase. Chromosome biorientation is made possible by the cohesion of replicated sister chromatids, which occurs along the entire length of the chromosome and is especially robust in large centromere-flanking or &#x0201c;pericentric&#x0201d; domains (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Sumner1" ref-type="bibr">Sumner 1991</xref>). The centromere is the site of assembly of the kinetochore, a protein complex that mediates the attachment and movement of chromosomes along the mitotic spindle. The centromere-flanking domains of cohesion are thought to play an important role in biorientation by constraining the kinetochores on paired sister chromatids in opposite directions. This orientation of sister kinetochores facilitates the capture of microtubules originating from different spindle poles, thereby ensuring that sister chromatids are segregated in opposition later in mitosis. A second function of pericentric cohesion and possibly cohesion along chromosome arms is to resist the poleward forces that are imposed by these bipolar spindle microtubule attachments. The resistance that is provided by cohesion prevents the premature dissociation of sister chromatids and contributes to a tension-based mechanism that stabilizes kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule interactions (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Nicklas1" ref-type="bibr">Nicklas and Ward 1994</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of cohesion in pericentric regions, it is critical to understand how these large functional domains are assembled. An important clue came with the discovery of a group of proteins that mediate cohesion and are conserved in organisms from the yeasts to vertebrates (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Guacci1" ref-type="bibr">Guacci et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Michaelis1" ref-type="bibr">Michaelis et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Furuya1" ref-type="bibr">Furuya et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Losada2" ref-type="bibr">Losada et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Skibbens2" ref-type="bibr">Skibbens et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Toth1" ref-type="bibr">Toth et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Hartman1" ref-type="bibr">Hartman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Tomonaga1" ref-type="bibr">Tomonaga et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Hanna1" ref-type="bibr">Hanna et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Losada1" ref-type="bibr">Losada and Hirano 2001</xref>). This group includes Pds5p and the members of a multisubunit &#x0201c;cohesin&#x0201d; complex, Mcd1/Scc1p, Irr1p/Scc3p, Smc1p, and Smc3p. Cohesins were shown to bind to specific regions of chromosomes (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Blat1" ref-type="bibr">Blat and Kleckner 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Megee2" ref-type="bibr">Megee et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Hartman1" ref-type="bibr">Hartman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Laloraya1" ref-type="bibr">Laloraya et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Panizza1" ref-type="bibr">Panizza et al. 2000</xref>). At centromere-distal locations, cohesin-binding sites span only approximately 0.8 kb (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Laloraya1" ref-type="bibr">Laloraya et al. 2000</xref>). In striking contrast, cohesin binding is highly enriched within an approximately 50-kb pericentric region of budding yeast Chromosome (CHR) III flanking the centromere&#x02013;kinetochore complex, which occupies only a 0.25-kb nuclease-resistant region (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">Bloom and Carbon 1982</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Saunders1" ref-type="bibr">Saunders et al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Blat1" ref-type="bibr">Blat and Kleckner 1999</xref>). It remains to be determined whether pericentric cohesin enrichment is unique to budding yeast CHRIII or is, in fact, a property of all pericentric regions. However, cytological observations support the notion that cohesin may be enriched in the centromere-proximal regions of all higher eukaryotic chromosomes, given that the chromosomes of mitotically arrested cells remain tightly associated in these regions (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez et al. 1991</xref>). These observations suggest that these large domains of pericentric cohesion result from an enrichment of cohesin binding.</p><p>How are these large cohesin domains assembled in kinetochore-flanking regions? Recent experiments in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content> have provided evidence for the role of repetitive heterochromatic DNA in pericentric cohesion. In this organism, the recruitment of high levels of cohesion factors to centromeric regions is dependent on Swi6 (SPAC664.01c), the fission yeast homolog of the heterochromatin protein HP1 (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Bernard1" ref-type="bibr">Bernard et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Nonaka1" ref-type="bibr">Nonaka et al. 2002</xref>). However, this is unlikely to be the only mechanism for generating large pericentric cohesin domains because the centromere on budding yeast CHRIII and neocentromeres in human cells are devoid of surrounding repetitive sequences characteristic of heterochromatin. One clue for a potential mechanism came from our observation that <italic>CEN3</italic> placed ectopically on a minichromosome could direct the binding of cohesin to approximately 2 kb of centromere-flanking DNA even if that DNA did not normally associate with cohesin, establishing that centromeres could modulate cohesin binding on neighboring sequences (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Megee2" ref-type="bibr">Megee et al. 1999</xref>).</p><p>The presence of these cohesin-enriched domains flanking <italic>CEN3</italic> on both the endogenous chromosome and a minichromosome is intriguing, and their existence has raised many interesting questions. Here, we endeavored to determine whether large pericentric cohesin domains exist on all budding yeast chromosomes, and if so, whether these domains are equivalent in size and have a similar distribution of cohesin. Furthermore, we examined the possible roles of the centromere and centromere-flanking sequences in the assembly of the pericentric cohesin domains. Our results show that the budding yeast kinetochore behaves as an enhancer in the assembly of approximately 20-kb to 50-kb pericentric cohesin domains. Our observations suggest that the kinetochore mediates two essential segregation functions, coordinating not only the attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, but also the recruitment of sufficient levels of cohesin within pericentric regions to promote biorientation of sister kinetochores and to resist microtubule-dependent poleward forces. Thus, the kinetochore functions as a modular segregation unit. The integration of these functions by the kinetochore is therefore likely to play an important role in the maintenance of genomic integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cohesin Is Enriched throughout Large Pericentric Domains Relative to Arm Sites</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that cohesin binding is highly enriched in the centromere-proximal region of CHRIII in comparison to arm sites and also within the centromere-flanking region of a <italic>CEN3</italic>-containing minichromosome in budding yeast arrested in mitosis using nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule assembly (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Blat1" ref-type="bibr">Blat and Kleckner 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Megee2" ref-type="bibr">Megee et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Laloraya1" ref-type="bibr">Laloraya et al. 2000</xref>). To examine cohesin binding throughout centromere-proximal and -distal regions of the budding yeast genome, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using epitope-tagged alleles of cohesin subunits (Mcd1-6HAp or Smc3-6Mycp) as markers for the cohesin complex. The immunoprecipitated (ChIP) and input DNA samples not subject to immunoprecipitation were then analyzed using two approaches (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In some cases, PCR reactions that respond linearly to the amount of input DNA were performed for both ChIP DNA and diluted input DNA to determine the percentage of total chromatin bound by cohesin subunits in the ChIPs. Alternatively, input and ChIP DNA samples were labeled with aminoallyl dUTP conjugated to different fluorescent tags, and then hybridized competitively to DNA microarrays containing all budding yeast open reading frames (ORFs) and intergenic regions to analyze cohesin binding genome-wide. In both types of experiments, we examined the distribution (i.e., the locations of peaks and valleys) and the magnitude (peak height) of cohesin subunit binding.</p><p>To determine whether the pericentric regions of all budding yeast chromosomes are similarly enriched for cohesin binding, input DNA and DNA crosslinked to Mcd1p in mitotically arrested cells were used to probe microarrays of the budding yeast genome. The profile of Mcd1p binding within each ORF and intergenic region was then superimposed on a map of the sixteen budding yeast chromosomes to visualize the distribution of Mcd1p association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). This analysis demonstrated dramatic differences in the distribution of Mcd1p in centromere-proximal and -distal regions of all sixteen budding yeast chromosomes, as had been observed previously in a study of CHRIII (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Blat1" ref-type="bibr">Blat and Kleckner 1999</xref>). While centromere-distal regions contained short, discrete foci (approximately 0.8 kb) of Mcd1p binding that were distributed at intervals of approximately 10 kb, centromere-proximal regions of all chromosomes contained large (approximately 20&#x02013;50 kb) domains that were highly enriched for Mcd1p binding. Microarray analyses were also performed using ChIP DNA isolated from strains containing both Myc-tagged Smc3p (Smc3-6Mycp) and HA-tagged Mcd1p (Mcd1-6HAp), or Smc3-6Myc alone to confirm that another subunit of the cohesin complex showed a similar enrichment in pericentric chromatin. As was the case with Mcd1p, the magnitude of Smc3p association was higher in pericentric regions than at arm locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Furthermore, the pattern of Smc3p binding observed within pericentric regions in independent immunoprecipitations of chromatin isolated from the singly or doubly tagged strains was strikingly similar to that observed for Mcd1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the high level of concurrence in cohesin subunit binding patterns suggests that the association of the entire cohesin complex is enriched in pericentric chromatin compared to chromosome arm locations. In addition, we compared the datasets obtained by microarray analyses in this study to those obtained using Myc-tagged Mcd1p (Mcd1-18Mycp) in another commonly used budding yeast strain background as described in the accompanying report by <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Glynn1" ref-type="bibr">Glynn et al. (2004)</xref>. These studies showed good agreement for the presence of enriched Mcd1p binding in pericentric regions and a similar distribution of peaks and valleys of binding at both pericentric and arm locations (correlation coefficient = 0.76; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Glynn1" ref-type="bibr">Glynn et al. 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0020260-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Microarray Analyses of Mcd1p and Smc3p Binding</title><p>DNA isolated from cohesin subunit ChIPs and control input DNA was labeled with aminoallyl dUTP, conjugated to Cy5 (red) or Cy3 (green) fluorescent tags, and then hybridized competitively to microarrays.

For comparison, Mcd1p association was also examined within an approximately 37-kb centromere-distal region on the right arm of CHRIII (<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database [SGD] coordinates 242&#x02013;279 kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We observed that the magnitude of Mcd1p binding throughout these pericentric regions is on average 3- to 5-fold higher than the levels of association observed at the CHRIII centromere-distal location. Within each of the pericentric domains examined, the distribution of Mcd1p binding was not uniform, but instead consisted of peaks and troughs of association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">3</xref>C). These peaks of Mcd1p binding were much broader than those observed at the CHRIII centromere-distal location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Blat1" ref-type="bibr">Blat and Kleckner 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Laloraya1" ref-type="bibr">Laloraya et al. 2000</xref>). The peaks of Mcd1p association within pericentric chromatin were separated by troughs having values approximately 0.5% of those of the input chromatin. Although significantly reduced in comparison to the peaks, Mcd1p association in these troughs reflects significant binding, given that other chromosomal regions such as <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ADE3</italic> are absent from Mcd1p ChIPs (&#x02264;0.04% of input chromatin; unpublished data not shown). Furthermore, this binding within troughs is unlikely to reflect poor shearing of the pericentric chromatin by sonication, as ChIPs performed using antibodies specific for the kinetochore protein Mif2p showed an enrichment within centromeric DNA that decreased 5-fold in flanking regions only approximately 245 bp away from <italic>CEN3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Lastly, it is interesting to note that in many of the pericentric regions, cohesin subunit association in the interval that contains the centromeric DNA was reduced in comparison to the regions immediately flanking the centromere, possibly because the large complex of kinetochore proteins precludes the association of cohesin with the relatively small 120-bp centromeric DNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">3</xref>C). Thus, microarray and PCR analyses of DNA crosslinked to cohesin subunits demonstrate that cohesin binding is highly enriched within large pericentric domains on all budding yeast chromosomes.</p><fig id="pbio-0020260-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Mcd1p Binding Profiles in Centromere-Proximal and -Distal Regions</title><p>Cells containing Mcd1-6HAp were first staged in G1 using &#x003b1;F, and then released from G1 into medium containing nocodazole to arrest the cells in mitosis.

Both the induced (acentric) and uninduced (centric) control cultures were then released from the G1 arrest into fresh medium and rearrested in mitosis. Once arrested in mitosis, cells were fixed in formaldehyde and then processed for ChIP using antiserum against epitope-tagged Mcd1p (Mcd1-6HAp) as an indicator of the cohesin complex.

Furthermore, the pericentric region of CHRXIV contained a series of closely spaced peaks of Mcd1p association that were roughly equivalent in magnitude. Thus, although all pericentric regions were indeed enriched for cohesin association, the uniqueness of the distribution of cohesin within each pericentric region suggests that cohesin binding is influenced by local sequence characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Enhancement of Pericentric Cohesin Binding Is Mediated by the Kinetochore</title><p>Although pericentric cohesin recruitment in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> likely occurs through an interaction with the heterochromatin constituent HP1 bound to repetitive DNA sequences, the absence of repetitive DNA flanking budding yeast centromeres indicates that some other mechanism is used for the recruitment of cohesin throughout large pericentric domains. One possibility is that the high density of cohesin within pericentric chromatin is dependent on the centromere&#x02013;kinetochore complex. To test this possibility, we examined Mcd1p association in the centromere-flanking regions of chromosomes in the presence and absence of the centromere. For these experiments, the endogenous centromeres on CHRIII and CHRXIV were replaced by <italic>CEN3</italic> and <italic>CEN14</italic> sequences, respectively, flanked by site-specific recombination target sites for the R recombinase from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Zygosaccharomyces rouxii</named-content> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

The absence of Mcd1 protein in G1-staged cells and the interdependency of cohesin subunit association with chromosomes suggest that centromere excision occurs prior to the loading of the cohesin complex onto chromosomes in our experimental regimen (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Guacci1" ref-type="bibr">Guacci et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Toth1" ref-type="bibr">Toth et al. 1999</xref>).

This reduction in Mcd1p binding occurred symmetrically throughout the entire 50-kb pericentric region flanking <italic>CEN3</italic>. In contrast, the magnitude of Mcd1p binding within a centromere-distal location on the arm of CHRIII was similar in both the centric and acentric chromosomes, indicating that cohesin association on chromosome arms is unaffected by centromere excision (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Furthermore, the magnitude of Mcd1p association within the pericentric region of an endogenous chromosome (CHRI) that did not undergo centromere excision was also unaltered (unpublished data). In agreement with the results for CHRIII, we also observed a symmetrical reduction in Mcd1p binding throughout an approximately 50-kb pericentric region on an acentric CHRXIV when compared to control cells that retained <italic>CEN14</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). While the magnitude of Mcd1p association was dramatically reduced in the former pericentric regions following centromere excision, the relative positions of the peaks and troughs of Mcd1p binding were unaltered. These results suggest that the centromere is required for the enrichment of Mcd1p binding in pericentric regions, where it amplifies an intrinsic local pattern of Mcd1p association. This amplification appears to occur bidirectionally, even though the DNA and protein components of the centromere&#x02013;kinetochore complex are inherently asymmetric (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Espelin1" ref-type="bibr">Espelin et al. 1997</xref>). In addition, the loss of pericentric cohesin binding upon centromere excision occurred despite the presence of centromeres on the remaining chromosomes. Thus, the enhancement of cohesin binding in pericentric chromatin requires a centromere in <italic>cis</italic>. These observations suggest that the budding yeast centromere and its associated factors together behave as a bidirectional enhancer to increase cohesin binding throughout large pericentric regions in every cell cycle.</p><p>While the removal of the centromere by site-specific recombination greatly reduced the levels of cohesin bound within pericentric DNA, we noted that the levels of binding within the valleys of the pericentric regions remained higher than the valleys observed in centromere-distal regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g003">3</xref>D). This observation suggested that pericentric sequences might contribute to the enhancement of cohesin association independent of the centromere. However, when the CHRIII centromere was moved to an ectopic location on the right arm of the chromosome, the residual levels of Mcd1p binding within the troughs throughout the former pericentric region were further reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In fact, this region now more closely resembled typical arm cohesin-association sites, where peaks of binding occur at approximately 10-kb intervals and are separated by regions with minimal or undetectable levels of cohesin association. Thus, this result suggests that cohesin enrichment within pericentric regions is mediated exclusively by the centromere&#x02013;kinetochore complex and that a centromere-independent pathway does not contribute to the enhanced levels of cohesin binding in pericentric chromatin. The residual levels of cohesin that remain bound in the troughs immediately following centromere excision may reflect a difference in the timing of centromere loss. In the centromere excision experiment, Mcd1p association was examined during mitosis of the same cell cycle in which the centromere was removed, whereas in the ectopic centromere strain, Mcd1p association was examined many generations after centromere removal. Thus, the persistence of cohesin binding during the first cell cycle following centromere excision suggests the existence of an epigenetic component in the recruitment of cohesin to pericentric chromatin. Indeed, possible epigenetic contributions to kinetochore function have been suggested previously in budding yeast (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Mythreye1" ref-type="bibr">Mythreye and Bloom 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0020260-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Mcd1p Binding within the Endogenous CHRIII Pericentric Region after Centromere Excision or Centromere Movement</title><p>The Mcd1p binding profiles in the endogenous CHRIII pericentric region are shown in cells in which the centromere is absent, either because of centromere excision (gray circles, PMY185) or because of the movement of the centromere to an ectopic location on the right arm of CHRIII (black triangles, PMY318).

Kinetochore assembly was disrupted using a conditional mutant in the <italic>NDC10</italic> gene. <italic>NDC10</italic> encodes an essential subunit of CBF3, a complex of kinetochore proteins that binds to the conserved centromere DNA element CDEIII and nucleates kinetochore assembly (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Goh1" ref-type="bibr">Goh and Kilmartin 1993</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 1993</xref>).

This difference is likely explained by the fact that the previous study examined Mcd1p binding within only one approximately 300-bp centromere-spanning region, whereas we examined Mcd1p association at multiple locations throughout 40-kb pericentric regions. To determine the extent to which kinetochore inactivation affected cohesin association at more centromere-distal locations, we examined global Mcd1p association in the <italic>ndc10-42</italic> mutant at the restrictive temperature using the hybridization of ChIP DNA to microarrays.

In cells containing the ectopically placed centromere, the peaks of Mcd1p binding occurred at the same locations as those observed in the wild-type cells, but the magnitude of binding was significantly higher, most notably within the peaks at 248 kb and 273 kb. Moreover, the levels of Mcd1p binding in the troughs proximal to the ectopic centromere were also dramatically elevated. Indeed, when the fold increases in cohesin binding flanking the ectopic centromere were plotted, the analysis revealed that similar levels of enhancement are reached throughout the approximately 37-kb region examined (median fold increase of 6.0 &#x000b1; 2.1), with the majority of the increase occurring in the trough regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020260-g009">Figure 9</xref>B).

The budding yeast centromere&#x02013;kinetochore complex generates a specialized chromatin structure, consisting of an approximately 250-bp nuclease-resistant region flanked by several positioned nucleosomes that together span approximately 3 kb (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">Bloom and Carbon 1982</xref>). Thus, the centromere-flanking cohesin domains are approximately 80&#x02013;200 times larger than the nuclease-resistant region of the kinetochore. The ability of kinetochores to mediate increased cohesin association over large domains was not limited to endogenous pericentric sequences, but also occurred when the centromere was moved to an ectopic location. Although rare, other examples exist in which <italic>cis</italic> DNA elements have been shown to mediate the generation of large chromosomal domains, namely telomeric silencing and X chromosome inactivation (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Renauld1" ref-type="bibr">Renauld et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Hecht1" ref-type="bibr">Hecht et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 1999</xref>). Finally, the kinetochore enhanced cohesin association in pericentric regions only in <italic>cis</italic> and in an orientation-independent manner. Thus, the kinetochore functions as an enhancer of pericentric cohesin binding in addition to mediating the attachment to the mitotic spindle.</p><p>The kinetochore-dependent generation of these extended pericentric cohesin domains may be the consequence of kinetochore-mediated de novo loading of cohesin, or, alternatively, the domains may reflect a role for the kinetochore in maintaining or protecting cohesin association in centromere-flanking regions. Evidence in support of both models exists. Cohesin association in the centromere-flanking region of a minichromosome was reduced upon centromere excision in M phase&#x02013;arrested cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Megee2" ref-type="bibr">Megee et al. 1999</xref>). In addition, high levels of cohesin association were observed in the CHRIII pericentric region of cells arrested in S phase or mitosis, while cohesin binding along the arms was lower in mitotically arrested cells compared to cells arrested in S phase (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Blat1" ref-type="bibr">Blat and Kleckner 1999</xref>). These observations are consistent with a role for the kinetochore in maintaining cohesin association in pericentric regions. However, the elevated levels of pericentric cohesin binding were not identical in the S phase&#x02013; and M phase&#x02013;arrested cells, but were in fact higher in the mitotically arrested cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Blat1" ref-type="bibr">Blat and Kleckner 1999</xref>). Furthermore, we have found that the magnitude of cohesin binding within pericentric regions of mitotically arrested cells increases in response to environmental cues (P. Megee, unpublished data). These observations are consistent with the de novo loading of cohesins by the centromere&#x02013;kinetochore complex. Thus, the kinetochore may mediate increased cohesin binding by multiple pathways.</p><p>Our finding that kinetochores mediate cohesin binding throughout large approximately 50-kb pericentric domains may potentially reconcile seemingly paradoxical observations concerning the enrichment of cohesin in pericentric chromatin and the transient loss of cohesion between sister chromatids in these regions. Despite the presence of these large pericentric cohesin domains, sister chromatids undergo transient separations within pericentric regions shortly after the formation of bipolar spindle microtubule attachments (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Goshima1" ref-type="bibr">Goshima and Yanagida 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-He1" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Tanaka2" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al. 2000</xref>). However, the extent of sister chromatid separation observed in these studies is consistent with the deformation of only approximately 20 kb of pericentric DNA (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-He1" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2000</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020260-He2" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that pericentric cohesin domains extend well beyond the approximately 20 kb of chromatin undergoing significant microtubule-dependent stretching. These observations suggest that pericentric cohesion may play dual roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. First, cohesin bound immediately adjacent to the kinetochore may sterically constrain the kinetochores on paired sister chromatids to face opposite poles, thereby facilitating the establishment of chromosome biorientation. Once biorientation is achieved, the poleward forces imposed by the microtubule attachments disrupt cohesin binding within approximately 20-kb pericentric regions, giving rise to transient sister chromatid separation. Because the kinetochore-mediated pericentric cohesin domain extends beyond the region of stretched chromatin, this domain may provide the resistance that is required for the production of tension between sister kinetochores (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Skibbens1" ref-type="bibr">Skibbens et al. 1995</xref>). This tension is thought to promote the stability of kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachments (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Nicklas1" ref-type="bibr">Nicklas and Ward 1994</xref>).</p><p>Our results also demonstrate that the distribution of cohesin within each pericentric domain differs between chromosomes and that the observed pattern is unrelated to the specific centromeric DNA sequence present on the chromosome. Instead, the distribution of cohesin in either endogenous or ectopic centromere-proximal locations is specified by an intrinsic property of the chromatin. Furthermore, although the ability of the centromeric enhancer to mediate cohesin binding extended over large domains, the loss of the kinetochore did not affect cohesin binding in centromere-distal regions (this study). This observation is consistent with two alternative explanations. First, the centromeric enhancer may form a gradient of activity that dissipates with distance from the kinetochore. This model is unlikely, however, since the fold increases in cohesin association adjacent to the ectopic centromere were similar throughout the flanking approximately 37-kb region. Alternatively, the length of pericentric chromatin that can be influenced by the centromeric enhancer may be constrained by <italic>cis</italic> factors, such as boundary elements or sequences nonpermissive for cohesin binding. Such a model is supported by the relatively small pericentric cohesin domain present on minichromosomes, where local sequence context was suggested to affect cohesin binding adjacent to the centromere (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Megee2" ref-type="bibr">Megee et al. 1999</xref>). Interestingly, during meiosis cohesins are removed from chromosome arms but remain bound in the large pericentric regions (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe and Nurse 1999</xref>). It is possible that the boundaries that dictate the pericentric region and constrain the centromeric enhancer are the same that modulate cohesin binding during meiosis. Moreover, since the distribution of cohesin association in pericentric regions appears to be unique to each chromosome, this variability in cohesin distribution may provide a basis for the range of nondisjunction frequencies associated with different chromosomes within an organism (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al. 1981</xref>).</p><p>In this report we have provided insights into the control of cohesin binding within pericentric chromatin in budding yeast. We have demonstrated that the centromere&#x02013;kinetochore complex behaves as an enhancer for cohesin association in pericentric chromatin and appears to be largely responsible for the increased levels of pericentric cohesin association at both endogenous and ectopic locations. Presumably, the enhancer functions by activating a <italic>trans</italic> factor that either recruits cohesin to pericentric chromatin or maintains high levels of pericentric cohesin binding. One candidate for such a <italic>trans</italic> factor could be a histone-modifying enzyme. The centromeric enhancer would augment the recruitment of the histone-modifying enzyme and enhance cohesin association. Indeed, results from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> indicate that a histone methyltransferase is targeted to centromere-proximal heterochromatin, and this modification is important for cohesin recruitment (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Bernard1" ref-type="bibr">Bernard et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Nonaka1" ref-type="bibr">Nonaka et al. 2002</xref>). Since budding yeast lacks centromere-proximal heterochromatin, the targeting method for pericentric cohesin recruitment is likely to be different. However, since pericentric cohesin domains are highly conserved, we suspect that the enhancer activity of the kinetochore may well be ubiquitous in all eukaryotes.</p><p>Our results suggest that the coordination of microtubule attachment and pericentric cohesin recruitment by the budding yeast kinetochore generates an autonomous segregation unit that ensures sister kinetochore biorientation and, consequently, the maintenance of genomic integrity. The integration of these activities by the kinetochore was likely key for the first identification of budding yeast centromeric DNA, since microtubule attachment in the absence of pericentric cohesion is unlikely to have increased the mitotic stability of minichromosomes, the assay used for centromere DNA identification (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">Clarke and Carbon 1980</xref>). Similarly, the coordination of cohesion and microtubule attachment by the kinetochore may also explain how neocentromeres in humans acquire full chromosome segregation capabilities in the absence of flanking repetitive DNA or cytologically detectable levels of pericentric heterochromatin (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Aagaard1" ref-type="bibr">Aagaard et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Saffery1" ref-type="bibr">Saffery et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Amor1" ref-type="bibr">Amor and Choo 2002</xref>). Our observations suggest that kinetochore-mediated cohesin recruitment may compensate for the lack of heterochromatin-dependent cohesin recruitment, thereby promoting biorientation of sister kinetochores. Moreover, the ability of a neocentromere to generate new domains of cohesin binding is likely to have been instrumental for chromosome evolution by allowing some degree of flexibility for chromosomal rearrangements.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Yeast cell culture</title><p>The genotypes of the yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020260-t001">Table 1</xref>.

Immunoprecipitations were done using 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), A-14 anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, United States), or rabbit polyclonal anti-Mif2p antibody (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Meluh1" ref-type="bibr">Meluh and Koshland 1997</xref>), as indicated. Immunoprecipitations of crosslinked chromatin prepared from strains lacking epitope-tagged versions of cohesin subunits did not precipitate centromeric DNA, as demonstrated previously (<xref rid="pbio-0020260-Megee2" ref-type="bibr">Megee et al. 1999</xref>). In addition, mock immunoprecipitations were performed to exclude the possibility that centromere-flanking chromatin was nonspecifically enriched in the immunoprecipitates obtained from epitope-tagged strains. We observed that centromeric sequences were enriched over those observed in the mock immunoprecipitations at least 500-fold and 11-fold using HA-tagged or Myc-tagged cohesin subunits, respectively. This difference likely reflects the observation that for any cohesin-associated region, a larger percentage of total chromatin is precipitated with the HA epitope tag than with the Myc tag (Mcd1-6HAp compared to Mcd1-18Mycp) (P. Megee, unpublished data). Lastly, analysis of the input DNA showed that our samples were routinely sheared to an average size of 500 bp, with a range of 200&#x02013;1,000 bp.</p><p>In all experiments, duplicate immunoprecipitations were performed for cohesin subunits and subjected to a preliminary PCR analysis using centromere-specific or -proximal oligonucleotide primer pairs. The duplicates had values that were routinely within 10% of one another, and, thus, one sample was chosen randomly for further analysis. The linearity of PCR under our experimental conditions was tested empirically. Briefly, input DNA was diluted 90-fold relative to immunoprecipitated DNA before PCR analysis. Increasing amounts of input DNA were then used to program PCR reactions, and the resulting products were quantitated to determine whether the amount of product responded linearly to the levels of input DNA (unpublished data; <xref rid="pbio-0020260-Megee2" ref-type="bibr">Megee et al. 1999</xref>). This relationship was determined empirically in experiments initiated with approximately 1.65 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> cells, and all subsequent experiments were performed with the same cell number to maintain linearity of PCR.</p><p>PCR fragments were separated on 2.5% NuSieve (Cambrex, East Rutherford, New Jersey, United States) gels containing 0.15 &#x003bc;g/ml ethidium bromide. Digital images of ethidium bromide&#x02013;stained gels were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, California, United States). The details of oligonucleotide primer pairs used for PCR analyses are available upon request. In general, PCR primer pairs amplified approximately 300-bp sequences and were separated from neighboring pairs by an average of approximately 1.5 kb. In the CHRIII pericentric region, the mean size of the 37 PCR products used in the ChIP analysis was 304 &#x000b1; 68 bp. For CHRXIV, the mean size of the 41 PCR products used in the analysis was 309 &#x000b1; 36 bp.
