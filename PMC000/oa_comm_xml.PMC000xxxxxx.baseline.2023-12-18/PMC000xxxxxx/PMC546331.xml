<article-title>DNA Recombination and Repair-A New Twist to RecA Function</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>The RecA protein forms nucleoprotein filaments on DNA, and individual monomers within the filaments hydrolyze ATP. Assembly and disassembly of filaments are both unidirectional, occurring on opposite filament ends, with disassembly requiring ATP hydrolysis. When filaments form on duplex DNA, RecA protein exhibits a functional state comparable to the state observed during active DNA strand exchange. RecA filament state was monitored with a coupled spectrophotometric assay for ATP hydrolysis, with changes fit to a mathematical model for filament disassembly. At 37 &#x000b0;C, monomers within the RecA-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) filaments hydrolyze ATP with an observed <italic>k</italic>

In vitro, the RecA protein catalyzes a DNA strand exchange reaction that mimics the presumed function of RecA protein in vivo. The RecA protein first forms a filament on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The bound ssDNA is then aligned and paired with a homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), forming a short (up to approximately 1 kilobasepair [kbp]) segment of paired DNA and initiating the DNA strand exchange [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

It is not clear how RecA protein-mediated ATP hydrolysis is coupled to these functions. Intriguingly, the core domain of the RecA protein (residues 34&#x02013;269) is structurally homologous to several motor proteins, including hexameric helicases [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and the mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Models for a motor-like coupling of ATP hydrolysis to DNA strand exchange in certain DNA metabolic situations have been proposed [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There is now evidence for at least four different functional states of RecA protein, occurring at different reaction stages. These have recently been designated O, Ac, Ao, and P [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

When RecA filaments form on ssDNA, they are in a structural and functional state designated A. Interconversion between the two different A states, which have somewhat different properties, is mediated largely by the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. However, all RecA filaments on ssDNA hydrolyze ATP with a <italic>k</italic>

<sub>D</sub>, for monomer addition to either filament end cannot be different unless an independent source of chemical energy is provided to affect the binding to one end or the other. As noted above, filament assembly does not require ATP hydrolysis, but filament disassembly does [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The hydrolysis of ATP by interior monomers does not generally result in dissociation, and under some conditions ATP hydrolysis can proceed with no evident dissociation of RecA monomers [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A simple model arises: ATP hydrolysis occurs everywhere, resulting in dissociation only for monomers at a disassembling end.</p><p>Within a RecA filament, ATP hydrolysis could occur at random, or it could be highly organized as cooperative waves traveling through the filament. There is no convenient method for monitoring the effects of ATP hydrolysis in the middle of a RecA filament. However, important clues can be ascertained by examining one effect of ATP hydrolysis: the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; end-dependent filament disassembly process. In effect, we cannot see waves of ATP hydrolysis within a filament, but we can monitor one of the waves&#x02014;the one occurring at the disassembling filament end.</p><p>The rate of disassembly can lead directly to an assessment of the degree of coupling of the ATP hydrolytic cycles of adjacent RecA monomers within the filament. For example, since RecA hydrolyzes ATP at a rate of approximately 30 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on ssDNA, each RecA monomer is hydrolyzing one ATP molecule every 2 s. If the ATP hydrolytic cycles of adjacent monomers are not coupled in any way, this will be reflected in a predictable rate of filament disassembly. When the end monomer hydrolyzes ATP and dissociates, the next monomer in line could be at any point within its ATP hydrolytic cycle. However, in a large population of filaments, the next monomer will be on average halfway through the cycle, and it will hydrolyze ATP (and dissociate) one second later. Dissociation of one RecA monomer per second will lead to a measured disassembly rate of 60 monomers of RecA per minute per filament end. This is close to the situation observed for RecA monomers formed on ssDNA (functional state A), which disassemble with a rate of 60&#x02013;70 monomers per minute per filament end [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Note that this is the slowest rate of disassembly compatible with the rate of ATP hydrolysis observed under the conditions of this experiment, and requires that every ATP hydrolytic event occurring in the RecA monomer at the disassembly end of the filament results in dissociation of that monomer. If the probability of dissociation upon ATP hydrolysis is less than 100%, the disassembly process would have to be slower than is observed.</p><p>A coupling of the ATP hydrolytic cycles of adjacent monomers could in principle lead to greater rates of filament disassembly. We are particularly interested in the status of RecA filaments formed on dsDNA and those promoting DNA strand exchange. As indicated above, these filaments are in the P functional state and exhibit a higher degree of coupling involving the hydrolytic cycles of adjacent monomers than is seen for filaments formed on ssDNA. If ATP hydrolysis is organized into cooperative waves traveling through the filament, then the rate of disassembly from dsDNA will reveal the rate of movement of one of the waves and the interval, <italic>i,</italic> between successive waves within the entire filament. For example, consider monomers within RecA filaments on dsDNA that are hydrolyzing ATP at approximately 20 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (or one ATP every 3 s). If ATP hydrolytic cycles of adjacent monomers are coupled within the filament so that ATP hydrolysis is organized in waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g003">Figure 3</xref>), then a new wave must reach a given monomer every 3 s to account for the observed <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub>. If the waves are four monomers apart (<italic>i</italic> = 4 monomers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), a wave must move from one monomer to the next one in line every 0.75 s.

The system is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g004">Figure 4</xref>A. RecA filaments are assembled on a linear ssDNA at a low pH, at which nucleation is fast enough that the DNA is saturated with RecA and there is little net disassembly (disassembling RecA monomers are rapidly replaced). The reaction mixture is then shifted to a higher pH, at which the rate of filament nucleation is slower and net filament disassembly can be observed. The rate of ATP hydrolysis will decline as RecA monomers dissociate from the DNA [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], reaching a nonzero steady-state endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). The steady-state rate reflects the final balance between disassembly and renucleation of RecA protein and filament formation on the ssDNA vacated by the disassembling filament. Since filament extension is very fast relative to disassembly, any nucleation event will result in a filament that extends from the nucleation point to the disassembling end of the first filament, and in effect create a new point for disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). On any of these DNA molecules, there is only one point where net disassembly occurs. Even when the second filament is not perfectly in phase with the first filament, such that some disassembly continues at the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), the RecA that dissociates from filament 1 at the junction is rapidly replaced by extension of filament 2 immediately behind it (filament extension is much faster than disassembly). Thus, there is no net change in bound RecA that would be reflected in the observed rates of ATP hydrolysis, except at the end of filament 2. To minimize the rebinding of RecA protein to vacated DNA, ssDNA-binding protein of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> (SSB protein) is added at the time of the pH shift [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

</p><p>The derivation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0030052-e001">equation 1</xref> is described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The assumptions incorporated into the equation and the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g004">Figure 4</xref> are also detailed elsewhere [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In brief, the assumptions are as follows. First, nucleation of filament formation is the rate-limiting step for RecA filament assembly. This assumption is documented in the Introduction of this paper and in previous reports [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Second, filament extension is faster than filament disassembly under all conditions. The simplest of the arguments [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] underpinning this assertion is that filaments would never form on DNA if RecA were subtracted from the disassembling end faster than it could be added to the extending end. Third, the model assumes that net disassembly is occurring at only one point in each filament. This is addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and follows from the fact that filament extension is faster than filament disassembly. There will be no net disassembly except at the 5&#x02032; proximal end of the RecA protein tracts on a given linear DNA. Any dissociation in the middle of a filament is rapidly replaced by the growth of trailing filament segments and thus cannot contribute to a net change in ATP hydrolysis. Finally, the assumption is made that the <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub> for RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis does not change in the range used for the pH shifts. This is documented elsewhere [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>On dsDNA, the situation becomes more complicated because it is more difficult to define the orientation of the filaments. RecA protein binds to the two strands of a duplex DNA unequally. One strand is bound at the site normally occupied by ssDNA. This strand orients the filament, and it is protected from nuclease digestion better than the second strand of a duplex [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. We will call this first strand the initiating strand [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In principle, either strand of a duplex can act as the initiating strand and organize the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; assembly of RecA filaments. RecA filaments can thus form in two orientations on dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). If nucleation occurs in the middle of a linear duplex so that the filament extends to one end, and a second nucleation occurs on the same DNA but in the opposite orientation, there could be two filaments on the same DNA, both with disassembling ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). This in turn would complicate the mathematical modeling of the disassembly reaction. This potential problem can be alleviated by supplying a good nucleation site in the form of a stretch of ssDNA. At pH 8 and above, RecA nucleation onto duplex DNA becomes very slow (measured in hours) [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. If a 5&#x02032; single-strand extension is added to one end of the DNA, the nucleation occurs within a few minutes, and RecA readily extends from the single-stranded segment into the adjoining duplex [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A 3&#x02032; single-strand extension does not work [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as would be predicted from the polarity of filament assembly from a nucleation site. This effect is seen in the experimental data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g005">Figure 5</xref>B. RecA binds to a linear duplex of 3,162 bp only after a lag lasting tens of minutes, even at pH 6.6. A linear duplex of similar length, but this time with a 5&#x02032; single-strand extension of 30 nt, is bound without a measurable lag at the same pH. This indicates that the filaments are nucleating on the single-strand extension, and virtually all of the resulting filaments in the population will have a unique orientation over the entire length of the DNA that is dictated by the single-stranded tail.</p><fig id="pbio-0030052-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>RecA Filament Formation on dsDNA</title><p>(A) RecA filaments can nucleate on dsDNA so as to have two different orientations. The initiating strand guides the orientation of each filament, with its polarity labeled in each panel. If two nucleations occur on the same filament, there can be two independent disassembly points.</p><p>(B) The effect of the 30-nt 5&#x02032; extensions on RecA protein filament formation. Reactions contained 4 &#x003bc;M RecA protein, 4 &#x003bc;M DNA, and no SSB and were carried out at pH 6.6. The tailed DNA substrate has 2,900 bp of duplex DNA with the 30-nt 5&#x02032; extension on one end. The completely duplex DNA is 3,162 nt in length. The enhanced nucleation afforded by these tails is evident in the rapid ATP hydrolysis seen when the tailed DNA is used as cofactor.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030052.g005"/></fig><p>To isolate the disassembly process so that it can be measured accurately, we must limit the rate of RecA rebinding to DNA that has been vacated as the RecA dissociates. Several parameters can be adjusted to accomplish this. The first one is pH. The rate of RecA protein disassembly reaches an apparent maximum at pH 8 and above [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The rate of disassembly should reach a maximum when every ATP hydrolytic event at the disassembling end results in dissociation of a RecA monomer. The rate of nucleation on dsDNA declines with increased pH such that working at high pH minimizes RecA rebinding. The second parameter is DNA length, which can affect the consequences of rebinding to duplex DNA. A nucleated filament is rapidly extended to the DNA end. A nucleation event on a long DNA will generate more bound RecA than a nucleation event on a short DNA. Thus, the use of shorter DNAs will limit the effects of each nucleation event. However, the DNA length cannot be reduced too much to suppress the levels of RecA protein rebinding, because a longer DNA (and filament) allows for a more gradual decline in the ATPase reaction that is easier to monitor. Trials using DNAs of several lengths indicated that a linear dsDNA with a length of approximately 3 kbp was optimal for this work [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These dsDNAs result in bound RecA filaments long enough (about 1,000 monomers) to disassemble over a time period of multiple minutes, while limiting the effects of RecA rebinding. As shown later, we also carried out measurements using dsDNAs of 2 kbp and 4 kbp. A third parameter that can be adjusted is SSB concentration. Adding SSB when the pH shift is carried out inhibits the rebinding of free RecA protein to the ssDNA extension. The concentrations of SSB used in these experiments were determined empirically to provide the maximum possible suppression of RecA renucleation. The effectiveness of this SSB-mediated suppression is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g006">Figure 6</xref>.</p><fig id="pbio-0030052-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The Effect of SSB Protein in Suppressing Rebinding of RecA to the Single-Strand Tails</title><p>(A) Normal RecA filament disassembly protocol. The RecA filaments were formed on the tailed DNA at pH 6.62. The pH was then shifted to 8.0 to allow disassembly to commence. Disassembly curves are shown in the presence and absence of SSB.

A linear duplex of 2,900 bp, with a 30-nucleotide 5&#x02032; single-strand extension, is bound with RecA protein at pH 6.62. The DNA concentration is 12 &#x003bc;M, so that the concentration of RecA binding sites is 2 &#x003bc;M. The RecA protein is added in excess (12 &#x003bc;M) to facilitate saturation of the DNA. After binding is complete, the rate of ATP hydrolysis is measured. The pH is then shifted abruptly to 8 by diluting the solution 2-fold into a solution with another buffer. The RecA and DNA concentrations undergo a 2-fold decrease during the pH shift, but the concentration of ATP and ATP regeneration components are kept constant. The pH shift initiates a net disassembly process that leads to a decline in ATP hydrolysis. Rebinding of RecA protein to the vacated single-strand extension is suppressed by SSB added with the pH shift buffers. The production of ADP is monitored. The ATP regeneration system is set up so as not to limit the observed results. For example, results were the same if the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentration was reduced from 3 to 1.5 mM.

The initial rates are essentially the same in each case, since the concentration of bound RecA is the same. If RecA dissociates from one end of the filament at a constant rate, disassembly of the longer filaments formed on longer DNAs should require correspondingly more time. The pattern seen here is consistent with that expectation. The final steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis reflects both <italic>k</italic>

The final steady state achieved after the major phase of filament disassembly is complete allows us to estimate the likelihood that multiple filaments with different orientations rebind to the same stretch of vacated DNA. We address this issue for the 3-kbp DNA substrate. Immediately following the pH shift, the concentration of RecA binding sites on the 6 &#x003bc;M DNA is 1 &#x003bc;M, and this represents the concentration of bound RecA at the outset. The average rate of ATP hydrolysis when disassembly was initiated was 19.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x003bc;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1.</sup> The average final steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis is 1.23 &#x003bc;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, or 6.3% of the rate observed prior to disassembly. This final rate corresponds to 6.3% occupancy of the available RecA binding sites, or 0.063 &#x003bc;M bound RecA protein. We estimate that the average filament at steady state occupies one-quarter of the available RecA binding sites in the DNA to which it is bound from the following considerations. When a new RecA filament nucleates onto the vacated DNA, the nucleation could occur anywhere along the length of the DNA. On average, the nucleation would occur at the center of the DNA, and the fast unidirectional filament extension phase would quickly coat the DNA from that point to one end, so that the typical new filament would occupy half of the available RecA binding sites on the DNA to which it was bound. At steady state, filaments would be disassembling at a rate that just balances the rate of renucleation of filaments to replace them (with the rate of disassembly much slower than filament extension). A given filament could be anywhere in the disassembly process, but the average filament bound at steady state will have lost half of its length. The average filament at steady state will thus occupy one-quarter of the RecA binding sites on a given DNA molecule. If 6.3% of the available DNA binding sites are occupied by RecA thus distributed in filaments that coat one-quarter of a DNA molecule, then we can estimate that 25.2% of the DNA molecules have some bound RecA protein. About 6% of the DNAs ([0.252]<sup>2</sup>, or approximately 0.06) will have two filaments bound. Half of these will have two filaments with the same orientation, and thus effectively have only one end where net disassembly will occur. The remaining 3% of DNAs with the potential for two bound filaments and two disassembling ends represent the maximum percentage of DNAs in this condition, and this maximum can only be approached late in the disassembly process after the DNA initially bound by oriented filaments has been vacated completely. Since the potential for multiple filaments is limited early in the dissociation curve, and 3% in any case is well within the error limits of our measurements, we have not adjusted our model or corrected our reported rates for this effect. To the extent that multiple disassembling ends contribute to the observed rates, they would lead to a very slight overestimate of the disassembly rate.</p><p>The interval between waves of ATP hydrolysis, <italic>i</italic>, is <italic>k</italic>

Successive waves occur at intervals of approximately six monomers and travel through the filament at a rate of approximately 120 monomers per minute. More precisely, the rate of RecA protein filament disassembly from dsDNA (which represents the ultimate wave) is 123 &#x000b1; 16 RecA monomers per minute per filament end, under the conditions of these experiments. While this is occurring, ATP is being hydrolyzed by monomers within the filament with a measured <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub> of 20.8 &#x000b1; 1.5 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The ratio <italic>k</italic>

<sub>off</sub>/<italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub> = <italic>i</italic> = 6.0 &#x000b1; 0.9 monomers. These results are taken from data in which the <italic>k</italic>

<sub>cat</sub> is not so constrained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030052-t001">Table 1</xref>). Given that there are six RecA monomers per helical turn of a RecA filament, this relationship reveals a striking pattern of ATP hydrolysis by RecA protein, one in which the ATP hydrolytic events at a given moment are lined up along one longitudinal face of the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g010">Figure 10</xref>). These &#x0201c;stripes&#x0201d; of ATP hydrolysis proceed around the circumference of the filament in six steps, with successive steps occurring at 0.5-s intervals. The overall pattern corresponds well to a rotary motor model for the coupling of RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis to DNA strand exchange, and fulfills the last of three major predictions of that model [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The motor function of RecA may play a role in certain aspects of the repair of stalled replication forks [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><fig id="pbio-0030052-g010" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Coordination of ATP Hydrolytic Waves in a RecA Filament</title><p>The dark monomers are those in the hydrolytic step of their hydrolytic cycle. The successive steps are separated by 0.5 s. The model shown assumes exactly six RecA monomers per helical filament turn and <italic>i</italic> = 6.0. As noted in the text, both the helical organization in the filament and the organization of ATP hydrolytic waves in RecA filaments may deviate slightly from this ideal. Note that there is no evidence that a RecA monomer in a filament is in contact with another RecA located six monomers away, so each of the gray balls shown in these illustrations are separated from their gray neighbors.

Importantly, the rate of RecA filament disassembly from dsDNA is nearly twice that from ssDNA [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], reflecting the change in functional state that is observed when a second strand of DNA is introduced into a RecA filament [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The observed rate of filament disassembly on dsDNA is three times that predicted for a similar filament with no ATP hydrolytic coupling between adjacent monomers. At a minimum, this must reflect an elaborate coordination of ATP hydrolytic cycles for adjacent RecA monomers in the filament. The functional state of RecA protein filaments on dsDNA is, in every experimental sense tested to date, identical to the functional state observed during active DNA strand exchange [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We therefore propose that the current results directly reflect the status of RecA filaments that are actively promoting DNA strand exchange.</p><p>The extent of coupling between RecA monomers inferred from the current experiments can be correlated to information derived from EM observations of the nucleoprotein filament.

Interestingly, previous EM reconstructions of the RecA-dsDNA complex indicate that there are 6.2 RecA monomers per helical turn of the nucleoprotein filament under at least some conditions [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This may imply an organization that is highly ordered, albeit not quite as ideal as the organization depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g010">Figure 10</xref>.</p><p>The RecA crystal structure does not reveal any contact between every sixth monomer in the helix [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This suggests that coordination within the filament is mediated through adjacent monomer-monomer contacts. With ATP hydrolytic waves spaced at six-monomer intervals, it is tempting to postulate a hydrolytic cycle with six distinct steps. In one turn of the helix, there could be six slightly different monomer conformations, corresponding to various stages of binding, hydrolyzing, and releasing nucleotide. Indeed, multiple conformations of RecA protein within the RecA nucleoprotein filaments have been observed [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Unlike a hexameric circle (such as the hexameric helicases to which RecA appears related), the synchronization between steps in the hydrolytic cycle could readily produce a noninteger separation of ATP hydrolytic waves (e.g., 6.2 monomers) in a filament. Although our average value of 6.0 for the parameter <italic>i</italic> is consistent with the idealized picture of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g010">Figure 10</xref>, the experimental error could readily accommodate such noninteger outcomes.</p><p>The ATP hydrolytic cycle should now become the focus of more intensive investigation. We have little information about the steps in the cycle as they occur on RecA protein, nor do we know to which step dissociation of a RecA monomer might be coupled. For example, the dissociating form of RecA could be almost any species one could imagine as an intermediate in the ATP hydrolytic cycle, such as a RecA-ADP complex, a RecA-Pi complex, or any of a number of other possibilities. The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g003">Figures 3</xref>B and10 works regardless of the precise mechanism of ATP hydrolysis proposed.</p><p>The patterns of ATP hydrolysis we observe in RecA filaments are quite distinct from those documented for other major filament types. The tubulins [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the actins [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] are filament-forming proteins that bind and hydrolyze GTP and ATP, respectively. The NTP hydrolysis affects the capacity of the filaments to assemble or dissociate. The proteins most readily assemble as the ATP- or GTP-bound forms. Very slow hydrolysis of the bound NTP results in a form that is more readily dissociated from the filament [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These filaments thus expand and contract in a pattern that is dictated by NTP hydrolysis, as well as by the activities of numerous regulatory proteins. The assembly and disassembly produces work at the filament ends. The ADP- or GDP-bound monomers in the filament interiors do not exchange nucleotides to rebind ATP or GTP, so there is no active nucleotide turnover within the filaments. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis occurs uniformly throughout a RecA protein filament formed on DNA. This ATP hydrolysis can result in filament disassembly at one end, as we continue to document here. However, the steady-state hydrolysis of ATP in the interior of RecA filaments does not result in dissociation and has the capacity to do a different kind of work. The rotary motor illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g010">Figure 10</xref> can be coupled to DNA strand exchange. That coupling is inferred by the capacity of RecA to drive strand exchange through heterologous DNA inserts [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], promote unidirectional strand exchange [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and promote strand exchange between two duplex DNAs [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]&#x02014;only when it is hydrolyzing ATP. The coupling is also seen in the predictable relationship that exists between the rates of ATP hydrolysis and branch movement during strand exchange [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and in a kind of indirect DNA helicase reaction that RecA promotes with certain branched DNA substrates [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. At least one potential biological role for this motor function can be found in the regression of stalled replication forks that is sometimes required for their repair [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].

If RecA protein is bound to a chromosome at a replication fork, and ATP is available, the surrounding DNA will not remain static.</p><p>We do not expect the organization revealed here for ATP hydrolysis in RecA filaments to apply generally to the eukaryotic homologs of RecA. The eukaryotic Rad51 protein hydrolyzes ATP at rates 30- to 40-fold below those reported for bacterial RecA proteins. RecA protein generally requires ATP hydrolysis for extensive strand exchange [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], while Rad51 protein does not [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. There are no reports that Rad51 can promote the kinds of reactions to which RecA protein couples ATP hydrolysis (four-strand exchange and strand exchange past a significant heterology in the DNA substrates) [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].

All DNA concentrations are given in terms of total nucleotides unless otherwise noted.</p><p>The 3-kbp linear double-stranded DNA substrate with a 30-nt single-stranded 5&#x02032; tail was generated by first digesting pUC119 plasmid DNA [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] with two restriction enzymes, SapI and SmaI. After digestion, residual protein was removed by sequential 1:1 extractions with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The resulting 2,883- and 279-bp fragments were concentrated by precipitation in ethanol. The 2,883-bp fragment was separated from the 279-bp fragment using size-exclusion chromatography with Sephacryl S-500 resin and concentrated with an Amicon Microcon concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States). Residual protein was removed by sequential 1:1 extractions with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The 2,883-bp fragment was concentrated by precipitation in ethanol. Two complementary oligonucleotides, 47 and 20 nt in length, were annealed and ligated in excess to the staggered end of the 2,883-bp fragment. Excess oligonucleotides were separated from substrate DNA using size-exclusion chromatography with Sephacryl S-500 resin. The substrate DNA was concentrated with an Amicon Microcon concentrator (Millipore). Residual protein was removed by sequential 1:1 extractions with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The substrate DNA was concentrated by precipitation in ethanol.</p><p>The 2-kbp linear dsDNA substrate with a 30-nt single-stranded 5&#x02032; tail was generated by first digesting pUC119 with EcoRI and AatII. The larger fragment was isolated via agarose gel extraction. The DNA ends were filled in with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated with T4 DNA ligase to result in the 2,223-bp pEAW373 plasmid DNA. The 4-kbp linear dsDNA substrate with a 30-nt single-stranded 5&#x02032; tail was generated by first digesting pUC119 with BanII that cuts at two sites, and the 2,766-bp fragment was separated from the 396-bp fragment via agarose gel extraction. Next, pACYC184 plasmid DNA [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] was digested with HindIII and AvaI, with the resulting 1,396-bp fragment isolated via agarose gel extraction. The DNA ends of the 2,766- and 1,396-bp fragments were filled in with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated with T4 DNA ligase to result in the 4,162-bp pEAW374 plasmid DNA. Both pEAW373 and pEAW374 maintained unique SapI and SmaI sites; they were treated in the same manner as the 3-kbp DNA substrate to yield 2- and 4-kbp linear dsDNA substrates with single-stranded 5&#x02032; tails. The lengths and sequences of the 5&#x02032; tails were the same in each of 2-, 3-, and 4-kbp DNA substrates.</p><p>To confirm the identity of the linear dsDNA substrates, a sample of each DNA substrate was digested with AflIII to yield a 133-bp fragment with a 4-nt 3&#x02032; tail and 30-nt 5&#x02032; tail. Digest of the duplex fragments without annealed oligonucleotides would have resulted in a 113-bp fragment with a 4-nt 3&#x02032; tail and 3-nt 5&#x02032; tail. Product separation in a 3.5% agarose gel confirmed the identity of the linear dsDNA substrate with a 30-nt 5&#x02032; tail and allowed quantitation of yield. In all DNA preparations used in these trials, the final yield of complete substrate DNA was greater than 97%.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Reaction conditions</title><p>All reactions were carried out at 37 &#x000b0;C in 25 mM buffer (detailed below), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 3 mM potassium glutamate, 3 mM ATP, an ATP regenerating system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3 mM or 2 mM PEP), and concentrations of DNA and RecA protein as described below and in figure legends. The coupled spectrophotometric assay also contained 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 3 mM NADH. Specific buffers used are described below and in the figure legends. DNA and protein concentrations are indicated for each experiment. Reactions were incubated for 10 min before ATP was added to start the reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4a4"><title>ATP hydrolysis assays<italic/>
</title><p>A coupled spectrophotometric assay was used to measure DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the RecA protein [<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030052-b93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The regeneration of ATP from ADP and PEP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH and monitored by the decrease in absorbance of NADH at 380 nm. The 380-nm wavelength was used instead of the absorption maximum at 340 nm so that the signal would remain within the linear range of the spectrophotometer for the duration of the experiment. The assay was carried out using a Varian Cary 300 (Varian, Palo Alto, California, United States) dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and 12-position cell changer. The cell path length and band pass were 0.5 cm and 2 nm, respectively. The NADH extinction coefficient at 380 nm of 1.21 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was used to calculate rates of ATP hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4a5"><title>Filament disassembly reactions</title><p>ATP hydrolysis reactions were started as described above in 25 mM MES/NaOH (76% anion, pH 6.62) buffer. Reactions contained 12 &#x003bc;M RecA protein, 12 &#x003bc;M (total nucleotides) linear duplex DNA, and the ATP and ATP regeneration conditions indicated above. These were incubated for approximately 20 min to reach a stable steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis. The rate was determined and reflected a virtually complete binding of all available DNA by RecA protein. Under these conditions, we routinely achieved rates reflecting an apparent <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub> for bound RecA protein (one monomer per three available DNA base pairs) of 18&#x02013;24 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The few reactions displaying initial rates reflecting a <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub> less than 18 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> generally reflected a problem with one or another reagent, and were discarded. After preincubation to achieve a DNA substrate saturated with RecA protein, the solution was subjected to a pH shift. The 200 &#x003bc;l reaction was diluted with gentle mixing into 200 &#x003bc;l of a solution (also preincubated at 37 &#x000b0;C), containing 25 mM Tris-acetate (30% cation, pH 8.50) buffer, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 3 mM potassium glutamate, 3 mM ATP, an ATP regenerating system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3 mM or 2 mM PEP), and 0.3 &#x003bc;M SSB. The final pH of the reaction after the pH shift was 8.00. The RecA and DNA concentrations were halved as a result of the pH shift, but the concentrations of ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and ATP regeneration system components were kept constant. Following the pH shift, the production of ADP was monitored spectrophotometrically as the RecA filaments disassembled. The rate of ATP hydrolysis declined, eventually settling to a slow steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis that reflects the minimal amount of bound RecA protein for a given experiment (see Results).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sv001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><title>Coordinated Waves of ATP Hydrolysis&#x02014;The Movie</title><p>This movie illustrates the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030052-g010">Figure 10</xref>.
