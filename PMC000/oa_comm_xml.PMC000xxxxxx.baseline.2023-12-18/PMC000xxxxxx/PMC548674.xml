Cancer cells produce proteinases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the plasminogen activator system (PAS) which promote invasion of extracellular matrices, but whether these proteinases degrade bone matrix is unclear. To characterize the role that breast cancer cell proteinases play in bone degradation we compared the effects of three human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 with those of a normal breast epithelial cell line, HME. The cell lines were cultured atop radiolabelled matrices of either mineralized or non-mineralized bone or type I collagen, the principal organic constituent of bone.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The 3 breast cancer cell lines all produced significant degradation of the 3 collagenous extracellular matrices (ECMs) whilst the normal breast cell line was without effect. Breast cancer cells displayed an absolute requirement for serum to dissolve collagen. Degradation of collagen was abolished in plasminogen-depleted serum and could be restored by the addition of exogenous plasminogen. Localization of plasmin activity to the cell surface was critical for the degradation process as aprotinin, but not &#x003b1;<sub>2 </sub>antiplasmin, prevented collagen dissolution. During ECM degradation breast cancer cell lines expressed urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and uPA receptor, and MMPs-1, -3, -9,-13, and -14. The normal breast epithelial cell line expressed low levels of MMPs-1, and -3, uPA and uPA receptor. Inhibitors of both the PAS (aprotinin and PA inhibitor-1) and MMPs (CT1166 and tisue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) blocked collagen degradation, demonstrating the requirement of both plasminogen activation and MMP activity for degradation. The activation of MMP-13 in human breast cancer cells was prevented by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but not by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, suggesting that plasmin activates MMP-13 directly.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data demonstrate that breast cancer cells dissolve type I collagen and that there is an absolute requirement for plasminogen activation and MMP activity in the degradation process.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in the female population of industrialized countries. Metastasis of breast cancer cells to the skeleton occur in &#x0003e;70% of patients with progressive disease, resulting in debilitating symptoms such as severe bone pain, fractures, hypercalcaemia and spinal cord or nerve compressions due to extensive bone loss and tumour cell growth and expansion. Such bone loss occurs as a result of increased bone matrix resorption but the mechanisms by which cancer cells mediate this increased degradation have not been fully elucidated. Obviously, tumour expansion in bone requires the removal of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that is particularly abundant in bone. Cancer cells express matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the plasminogen activator system (PAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and their levels of expression increase with progression of the tumour.</p><p>The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) constitute a large family of structurally related matrix degrading proteases that have pivotal roles in development, tissue remodelling, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The gene family of MMPs includes the interstitial collagenases (MMPs-1 and -13), gelatinase A (MMP-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9), the stromelysins (MMPs-3, 10 and 11) and the membrane type-matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs 14,15,16,17, 24 and 25) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The MMPs have the combined ability to degrade the major components of the ECM including type I collagen, the principal organic constituent of bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The PAS comprises: tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), their inhibitors, and receptors. T-PA is thought to be more important in fibrinolysis, due to its fibrin binding capacity, whilst u-PA, especially when it is bound to its specific cell surface receptor (u-PAR), is thought to be involved in tissue remodelling and cell migration processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Whereas uPA alone recognizes a narrow range of substrates, the enzyme can catalyze the conversion of the circulating zymogen, plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin, in turn, is a broad- spectrum proteinase that can directly degrade multiple ECM targets and can also cooperate with other ECM-degrading enzymes including members of the MMP gene family. Regulation of the PA/plasmin system is achieved mainly via plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) type-1 and type-2 and by agents that stimulate bone resorption, e.g. parathyroid hormone (PTH) and interleukin (IL)-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>To date, emphasis has focused on the ability of breast cancer cells to stimulate the formation and activity of osteoclasts, the cell primarily responsible for bone resorption under physiological conditions. The ability of osteoclasts to degrade bone lies in their ability to secrete protons and specialized collagenolytic proteinases, the cysteine proteinases in the acidic microenvironment that underlies osteoclasts during bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Experimental studies showing that increased expression of MMPs and the PAS is associated with increased cellular invasion <italic>in vivo </italic>support the idea that they play an important role in metastasis of tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Obviously tumour expansion in bone necessitates the removal of the ECM that is particularly abundant and resistant to degradation. Synthetic inhibitors of MMPs have been developed and two recent reports on their use on <italic>in vivo </italic>breast cancer metastasis to bone show promise when given as a preventive treatment to mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the role of MMPs and the PAS in mediating breast tumour bone collagen dissolution has not been addressed.</p><p>We have therefore assessed the ability of three human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231), ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 to degrade bone collagen <italic>in vitro </italic>using matrix degradation assays and compared their effects with those of a normal breast epithelial cell line, HME. We correlated the degradation activity of the breast cancer cells with their expression of MMPs and the PAS and we assessed the ability of group-selective proteinase inhibitors to prevent degradation of the organic aspect of bone by breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Type I collagen degradation</title><p>Bone degradation involves an initial phase of removal of the unmineralized type I collagenous layer followed by degradation of the mineralized matrix which also comprises type I collagen. The fibrillar integrity of the collagen layer was confirmed by incubation with collagenase that degraded the film whilst the collagen fibres were resistant to degradation by both trypsin and plasmin (data not shown). When the breast cancer cells (MDA-231, ZR-75-1 or MCF-7) were stimulated with TGF&#x003b2;(10<sup>-10</sup>M) and cultured in the presence of 10% FCS the cancer cells induced significant degradation of type I collagen (range 70&#x02013;80%), whereas minimal degradation was observed in the absence of serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). To investigate the possible role of the PAS in collagen breakdown by breast cancer cells, plasminogen was depleted from FCS by lysine-Sepharose chromatography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, the depletion of plasminogen from serum also completely blocked breast cancer cell mediated collagen dissolution, implicating the PAS in breast cancer-mediated collagen degradation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In accordance with this finding, the breast cancer cells degraded collagen under serum-free conditions only when supplemented by exogenous plasminogen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The TGF&#x003b2;-stimulated normal breast cell line, HME cultured in the presence of 10 % FCS demonstrated low type I collagenase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Degradation of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled type I collagen films by breast cancer cells. </bold>Breast cancer cells (10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well) stimulated with TGF&#x003b2; (10<sup>-10 </sup>M) were cultured for 24 h on <sup>14</sup>C-labelled type I collagen under the following conditions: serum-free conditions; presence of 10% serum; 10% plasminogen (Plg)-depleted serum; serum-free medium supplemented with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml of human Plg.

However, the midpoint melting temperature of reconstituted firbrillar type I collagen (47&#x000b0;C) is lower than that of authentic type I collagen in tissues (55&#x000b0;C to 60&#x000b0;C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Because the proteinase resistance of type I collagen can be compromised at temperatures within 10&#x000b0;C of that at which the helix reversibly unfolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], reconstituted fibrillar collagen may provide a less resistant substrate to proteolytic activity. Hence to determine whether breast cancer cell mediated degradation of type I collagen could be extended to a more physiological system, cancer cells were cultured on bone matrix as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Bone matrix degradation by breast cancer cells</title><p>The described sequential gene expression of differentiating osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] was verified in MC3T3-E1 cell cultures so that non-mineralized matrix production was prepared after collagen production had commenced but before mineralization started.

More recently it has been demonstrated that prostate cancer cells and melanoma cells directly degrade mineralized bone matrix and that the degradation was reduced by generalized inhibition of MMP activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Whereas the induction of MMPs in TGF&#x003b2; stimulated breast cancer cells that are actively engaged in tumour osteolysis has not been examined previously, this growth factor has been reported to increase the expression of MMPs-1, -3 and -9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In our study TGF&#x003b2; induced a complex MMP expression profile that included MMPs-1, -3, -9 -13, and -14 as the principle products. Furthermore, MMPs are able to release and activate TGF&#x003b2;, a very abundant bone matrix-bound factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The fact that breast cancer cells degraded the non-mineralized bone matrix to a greater extent than the mineralized substrate, suggests that access of the matrix degrading proteinases to the organic phase of the matrix may have been restricted by the mineralized phase.</p><p>This investigation has demonstrated a significant difference in the ability of breast cancer cells and normal breast epithelial cells to degrade the organic aspect of bone matrix <italic>in vitro</italic>. Variations in the profile and amounts of proteinases expressed by the different cell lines may be responsible. Since the MMP inhibitors used in this study (CT1166 and TIMP-1) inhibit the activities of all MMPs, except the membrane-type MMPs in the case of TIMP-1, we cannot identify the contribution of individual MMP members to bone matrix degradation. However, our demonstration of a direct requirement of plasmin in the activation of proMMP-13 suggests that this fibrillar collagenase may play a prominent role in the degradative activity of breast cancer cells. However, the possibility of other known MMPs also being involved in plasminogen-dependent collagenolysis by breast cancer cells cannot be excluded. The participation of the membrane-type MMPs such as MMP-14, -15 and -16 is improbable due to the ability of TIMP-1 to effectively block collagen dissolution by breast cancer cells. MMP-2 and &#x02013; 8 were not expressed in detectable amounts by breast cancer cells, as assessed by RT-PCR. The existence of very small, but functionally important, amounts of MMP-2 or &#x02013; 8 however cannot be excluded unequivocally by the expression studies. MMP-1 is expressed by the human breast cancer cells in this study and may contribute to plasmin-dependent fibrillar collagen dissolution.</p><p>Currently, little is known with regard to the physiological mechanisms by which MMPs undergo activation in intact cell systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, a primary function of the uPA-uPAR couple is to focus the processing of the plasminogen zymogen to active plasmin on the cell surface. It has recently been demonstrated that binding of u-PA to its receptor increases pro-MMP-2,-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and -13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] activation, and that in the absence of cells, plasmin not only fails to activate pro-MMPs, but rapidly degrades them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This would explain why interfering with only one element, plasmin or MMP activity, has such powerful biological effects. It should be stressed, however, that few of the cascades or activities have been unequivocally documented in intact cell systems. Nonetheless, because MMP-specific inhibitors are not yet available, the individual role of each of the cell-derived MMPs awaits the use of interventions based on RNA inhibition.</p><p>The increased bone resorption that accompanies breast cancer cell infiltration of bone may arise as a result of (1) breast cancer cells stimulating osteoblast and osteoclast activity and (2) the production by breast cancer cells of proteinases that participate in degrading the organic aspect of bone matrix which would also facilitate the access of osteoclasts to the underlying mineralized matrix.</p><p>Even if tumour-derived MMPs do not directly digest mineralized matrix, they may participate in osteolysis via a mechanism that is analogous to a known osteoblast function. It is believed that all endosteal surfaces are covered with a layer of nonmineralized matrix. In areas of bone formation, this layer is called osteoid and it is easily observed in stained sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Evidence is accumulating that degradation of this layer must occur before the attachment of osteoclasts to the underlying mineralized matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In normal remodelling, digestion of this layer is apparently accomplished by MMPs produced by osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is conceivable that breast cancer cells in bone adopt this osteoblast function; thus, the possibility that MMPs produced by cancer cells enhance osteoclastic degradation by prior removal of the overlying unmineralized layer. Furthermore, removal of this layer may be partially responsible for the recruitment and activity of osteoclasts due to the release of osteoclast attractants/stimulants. Bone resorption by osteoclasts is augmented experimentally by coating mineralized matrix with collagenase-cleaved collagen fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As nonmineralized matrix is degraded, osteoclasts may be exposed to extracellular proteins, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, osteopontin or other cryptic epitopes. Osteoclasts bind to these proteins via integrins a process that may enhance bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have shown that breast cancer cells can degrade the organic aspect of bone matrix in contrast to non-tumourogenic breast epithelial cells. There is an absolute requirement for both the PA system and MMPs in the degradation process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The MMP inhibitor CT-1166 was a generous gift from Dr A Docherty, Celltech (Slough, UK).
