<article-title>A Method for Studying Calcium Dynamics in Transgenic Mice</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicator proteins (FCIPs) are promising tools to study calcium dynamics in many activity-dependent molecular and cellular processes. Great hopes&#x02014;for the measurement of population activity, in particular&#x02014;have therefore been placed on calcium indicators derived from the green fluorescent protein and their expression in (selected) neuronal populations. Calcium transients can rise within milliseconds, making them suitable as reporters of fast neuronal activity. We here report the production of stable transgenic mouse lines with two different functional calcium indicators, inverse pericam and camgaroo-2, under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter. Using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays, we find that stimuli known to increase intracellular calcium concentration (somatically triggered action potentials (APs) and synaptic and sensory stimulation) can cause substantial and rapid changes in FCIP fluorescence of inverse pericam and camgaroo-2.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Winfred Denk and colleagues succeed in generating transgenic mice that express one of two calcium indicators in their cells, creating a valuable tool to study neuronal activity</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central to the study of neuronal networks is the simultaneous measurement of activity at many locations. While important results have been obtained using multiple patch recordings (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Stuart1" ref-type="bibr">Stuart et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Markram1" ref-type="bibr">Markram 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Markram2" ref-type="bibr">Markram et al. 1997</xref>) and microelectrode arrays (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Meister1" ref-type="bibr">Meister et al. 1994</xref>), patch recordings are limited to a few points and electrode arrays can only record spiking activity or compound field potentials. Furthermore, electrical recordings cannot resolve activity in fine branches of individual neurons and are blind to biochemical signals. Optophysiological approaches have, therefore, become strong competitors and complementors of valuable electrophysiological methods for studying neural activity. First attempts used intrinsic optical signals (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al. 1968</xref>) followed by specific chromophores for sensing membrane voltage by absorption (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-George1" ref-type="bibr">George et al. 1988</xref>) or fluorescence changes (for a review see <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Cohen2" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al. 1978</xref>). Other dyes were found (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Gorman1" ref-type="bibr">Gorman and Thomas 1978</xref>) and later specifically designed that respond to changes in intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentration (for a review see <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Tsien1" ref-type="bibr">Tsien 1992</xref>). Although changes in membrane potential are the most direct measurement of neuronal activity, the large fractional changes achievable with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fluorophores led to a rapid adoption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Tank1" ref-type="bibr">Tank et al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">Ross et al. 1990</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Sugimori1" ref-type="bibr">Sugimori and Llinas 1990</xref>), which acquired additional importance with the discovery that the induction of synaptic plasticity in many cases requires a substantial rise in local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Malenka1" ref-type="bibr">Malenka et al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 1999</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> furthermore plays a role in morphological changes of neurites (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Yuste1" ref-type="bibr">Yuste and Bonhoeffer 2001</xref>) and in gene regulation (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">Morgan and Curran 1986</xref>).</p><p>Loading a population of cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators has proven difficult in adult neural tissues. While there has been a recent advance (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Stosiek1" ref-type="bibr">Stosiek et al. 2003</xref>), it is unclear how cell-type specificity could ever be achieved by techniques of bulk loading synthetic indicators. Great excitement, therefore, greeted the molecular engineering, several years ago (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Miyawaki1" ref-type="bibr">Miyawaki et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Persechini1" ref-type="bibr">Persechini et al. 1997</xref>), of GFP variants that are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive (fluorescent calcium indicator proteins [FCIPs]). Two classes of genetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators have been designed that use different mechanisms of action. The first class, called &#x0201c;cameleons&#x0201d; (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Miyawaki1" ref-type="bibr">Miyawaki et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Miyawaki2" ref-type="bibr">Miyawaki et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Nagai2" ref-type="bibr">Nagai et al. 2002</xref>), depends on changes in the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two spectral variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that are connected by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive linker. The second class uses a single GFP fluorophore that contains a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein as a sequence insert (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Baird1" ref-type="bibr">Baird et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Griesbeck1" ref-type="bibr">Griesbeck et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">Nagai et al. 2001</xref>). In addition to solving the loading problem, major advantages of genetic indicators are the prospect of targeting specific cell types by using appropriate promoters and the possibility of combining long-term studies of neuronal activity and morphology (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Grutzendler1" ref-type="bibr">Grutzendler et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Trachtenberg1" ref-type="bibr">Trachtenberg et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The ability to express FCIPs in intact animals has in recent years allowed the measurement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients in worm (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Kerr1" ref-type="bibr">Kerr et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al. 2003</xref>), fruitfly (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Fiala1" ref-type="bibr">Fiala et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Reiff1" ref-type="bibr">Reiff et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. 2003</xref>), zebrafish (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Higashijima1" ref-type="bibr">Higashijima et al. 2003</xref>), and, more recently, mouse (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Ji1" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al. 2004</xref>). Thus far, there are still no reports of transgenic mice that express functional FCIPs in the brain. Clearly, expression of a functional indicator in the mammalian brain would enable the measurement of neuronal population activity with much higher spatial and temporal resolution than are offered by currently used noninvasive methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and intrinsic signal reflectance imaging. Moreover, in combination with two-photon imaging (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Denk2" ref-type="bibr">Denk et al. 1990</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Denk1" ref-type="bibr">Denk and Svoboda 1997</xref>), transgenic indicators would allow the simultaneous recording of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in neurons and neuronal compartments from multiple sites in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>In this paper we demonstrate that FCIPs can be transgenetically introduced into mice under the control of the tetracycline (TET) regulation system (for a review see <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Gossen2" ref-type="bibr">Gossen and Bujard 2002</xref>) and are expressed and function widely throughout the nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of Transgenic Mice</title><p>To select indicators for the generation of transgenic mice, we first screened a number of FCIPs in HeLa cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) for brightness, large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-depen-dent fluorescence changes, and inducibility.

Signals were significant even for low odor concentrations (e.g., 0.1% 2-Hexanone; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g008">Figure 8</xref>C), and they increased with concentration.

This is presumably because FCIP is also expressed in granule cells. These receive input from secondary dendrites of mitral cells, which project for several hundreds of micrometers around each glomerulus. Nevertheless, each odor evoked a unique activity map, and odors known to evoke similar maps of glomerular afferent activity (e.g., methyl benzoate and benzaldehyde) evoked similar activity patterns in transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g008">Figure 8</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g008">8</xref>F). The more localized signals seen with Cg2 may be due to its lower affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, reporting only high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the vicinity of activated glomeruli. Alternatively, Cg2 might be expressed more strongly in olfactory receptor axons.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have demonstrated that genetically encoded FCIPs can be stably expressed in mice and are functional. Transgenically expressed FCIPs showed changes of up to 100% in response to synaptic stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g602">Figure 6</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g602">6</xref>F). These changes are smaller than those seen in cell culture or protein extracts (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Griesbeck1" ref-type="bibr">Griesbeck et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">Nagai et al. 2001</xref>), suggesting that a fraction of protein, possibly immobile and sequestered, is nonresponsive. The size of the immobile fraction seen in bleach-recovery experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g004">Figure 4</xref>E) fluctuates strongly around a mean value of roughly 50% of the total FCIP fluorescence. Fluorescence changes evoked by electrical stimulation in the neuropil show that FCIPs respond quickly to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The relative fluorescence changes recorded in slices in response to synaptic stimulation are large when measured by two-photon microscopy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g602">Figure 6</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g602">6</xref>F) but are substantially smaller with wide-field microscopy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g601">Figure 6</xref>C), presumably because signals from activated and nonactivated cells inevitably mix because of a lack of optical sectioning in the wide-field case. In whole-cell tight-seal recordings somatic signals may fade additionally due to washout of responsive protein. Since camgaroos and pericams are intrinsically pH-sensitive (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Baird1" ref-type="bibr">Baird et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Griesbeck1" ref-type="bibr">Griesbeck et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">Nagai et al. 2001</xref>) it is possible that the fluorescence changes contain a component due to changes in [H<sup>+</sup>] (pH) rather than [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. It is, however, unlikely that the changes we saw are dominated by pH effects for the following reasons. In the case of Cg2, stimulation-induced pH changes (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. 2003</xref>) should lead to a <italic>decrease</italic> in fluorescence while we see an <italic>increase</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g602">Figure 6</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g602">6</xref>F). For IP the change due to pH would be in the same direction, but, in particular, the size of the changes seen during two-photon measurements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g602">Figure 6</xref>F; &#x0223c;30%) are almost an order of magnitude larger than what one might expect from pH changes that occur with high [K<sup>+</sup>] stimulation (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. 2003</xref>), but see <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al.

Furthermore, changes of pH are much slower than those seen in our synaptic stimulation experiments.</p><p>The robust and fast FCIP signals detected in response to sensory stimulation in vivo confirm that FCIPs are suitable for their main intended use, the imaging of activity from populations of neurons in living animals<italic>.</italic> Crucial for addressing functional questions in neuronal networks will also be the cell-type specificity of expression, which we have demonstrated here for the population of &#x003b1;CamKII-positive neurons.</p><p>Our success rate in generating functional transgenic mouse lines for Cg2 and IP was moderate (five of 36 animals that were transgenic, according to DNA typing; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). YC3.12 was a disappointment and did not yield functional lines. This is consistent with a previous attempt to generate transgenic mice expressing YC3.0 under the control of the &#x003b2;-actin promoter (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al. 2003</xref>). There, animals were produced that also showed mosaic expression patterns and had only very small functional signals (&#x00394;R/R &#x0223c;1%&#x02013;2%) when tested by wide-field imaging of cerebellar slices undergoing synaptic stimulation (A. Miyawaki, V. Lev-Ram, and R.Y. Tsien, unpublished data).</p><p>An early suggestion that indicator proteins become nonfunctional after expression for an extended period of time (O. Griesbeck, personal communication) certainly does not apply to IP and Cg2 since we found large responses even in mice aged 8&#x02013;12 wks, which had been expressing indicators since the onset of &#x003b1;CamKII expression before birth. However, even in strongly expressing smooth-fluorescence lines, a substantial fraction of the indicator protein was found to be immobile and potentially nonfunctional at various ages. It is surprising that punctate fluorescence occurs predominantly in weak lines since precipitation typically occurs at high concentrations. It could, however, be that a limited number of binding and sequestration sites for FCIPs exist in the cell and that only after these sites are saturated does the accumulation of mobile (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g003">Figure 3</xref>J), cytosolic, and responsive FCIP begin. The accumulation of any functional indicator protein might, therefore, require expression levels above a (rather high) threshold. Such a threshold might explain why in the majority of lines we find weak, nonresponsive, and punctate fluorescence even when there is significant luciferase activity (open circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Binding and/or sequestration of FCIP does, of course, raise the specter of interference of the indicator with biochemical processes inside labeled cells. While subtle effects cannot be ruled out at this point, we did not see any obvious abnormalities either at the whole-animal level or at the level of cellular morphology. The labeled neurons, furthermore, are connected synaptically (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g601">6</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g008">8</xref>). It will, however, be important to understand and if possible remedy the reasons for the formation of precipitates. Perhaps the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing motifs (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Heim1" ref-type="bibr">Heim and Griesbeck 2004</xref>) that lack affinity for proteins normally expressed in neurons will eliminate puncta and the immobile fraction. It is unclear why high expression levels appear to be achievable in brain using the TET promoter system but not other, cellular promoters. One explanation for weakness or outright lack of expression might be that sequences within the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicator genes silence cellular promoters (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al. 1997</xref>) but not the tTA-responsive promoters (including Ptetbi). The reason for this, in turn, might be that cellular promoters (unlike the TET promoter) contain a substantial number of transcriptional control elements (upstream activator sequences), any of which might be sensitive to chromatin-induced silencing by the FCIP gene (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Lemon1" ref-type="bibr">Lemon and Tjian 2000</xref>). This is supported by the observation that attempts to create transgenic mice expressing IP under the control of a 3.5-kb gonadotrophic-releasing-hormone promoter fragment resulted in many lines that had the gene inserted but showed at best weak and punctate expression (D.J. Spergel and P.H. Seeburg, personal communuication), similar to our low-expression lines, while the same promoter fragment drove hGFP2 (an EGFP variant) to high levels (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Spergel1" ref-type="bibr">Spergel et al. 1999</xref>). Similarly, only weak expression was observed when YC3.1 was placed under control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Futatsugi1" ref-type="bibr">Futatsugi et al. 2002</xref>; A. Miyawaki, personal communication).</p><p>One of the remaining problems hampering imaging of population activity with FCIPs is that expression, while cell-type specific, is not complete, i.e., not in every cell of one type, even in lines that express FCIPs at high levels. One possible explanation is position effect variegation (PEV), which occurs when a transgene integrates adjacent to a heterochromatin domain in the genome. In such a situation, expression of the locus variegates, being active in some cells and silent in others (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Saveliev1" ref-type="bibr">Saveliev et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020163-Schotta1" ref-type="bibr">Schotta et al. 2003</xref>). If this is the case, it might be possible to avoid mosaicism by generating lines free from PEV by cloning FCIP genes into a bacterial artificial chromosome (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Shizuya1" ref-type="bibr">Shizuya et al. 1992</xref>) derived from a TET responder line that is not prone to PEV (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Hasan1" ref-type="bibr">Hasan et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>In any case, it appears that the use of the TET system allows the expression of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators in mice, albeit for an unexpected reason. Unlike other promoter systems, such as the CMV promoter, which also appears to resist gene silencing, the TET system allows cell specificity via the expression of the transactivator, which appears to be controllable by cellular promoters without gene silencing.</p><p>The creation of transgenic mouse lines expressing functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators opens the way for the measurement of neural activity patterns in mammals in vivo and in vitro. While the sensitivity of genetic indicators does not (yet) quite reach those of synthetic compounds, it is sufficient for single-trial measurements at least in some applications (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020163-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Perhaps the greatest advantage is that the genetically encoded indicators alleviate the labeling problem in general and allow the observation of activity in targeted cell populations without the need to load cell or tissue preparations with synthetic indicators using potentially harmful procedures. In vivo imaging of FCIPs will permit analysis of population activity using minimally invasive procedures such as imaging through the intact skull. Applications for FCIPs are similar to those for intrinsic signal imaging, but FCIPs provide substantially higher spatiotemporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Compared to voltage-sensitive dyes, transgenic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators yield substantially larger signals and obviate surgical procedures for dye loading. Another important advantage of transgenic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators is that the optical signal can be interpreted more specifically because of its defined cellular origin. In combination with two-photon microscopy, neuronal activity can be mapped at high resolution, down to the level of individual dendritic branchlets and maybe spines, possibly even in awake, behaving animals (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Helmchen1" ref-type="bibr">Helmchen et al. 2001</xref>). In addition, FCIP lines may be crossed with mouse lines in which the expression of genes of interest has been manipulated. For example, the combination of FCIP mice with lines harboring modifications of plasticity-driven genes (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Nakazawa1" ref-type="bibr">Nakazawa et al. 2002</xref>) or genes that cause neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="pbio-0020163-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al. 2002</xref>) might help us to understand how specific genes are involved in the construction and experience-dependent modification of brain circuitry.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Screening of indicators and generation of transgenic mice</title><p>Genes encoding six different Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (flash pericam, IP, CaMP, Cg2, and cameleons YC2.12 and YC3.12) and <italic>FL</italic> were cloned into a Ptetbi vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States).

Spectral recordings were performed with a confocal microscope (TCS SP2 AOBS; Leica) using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm.

Mice were deeply anesthetized with halothane. After decapitation the brain was quickly removed and placed into ice-cold, oxygenated artifical cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; Biometra Biomedizinische Analytik, Gottingen, Germany) containing 125 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM glucose, and 2 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.4). For the two-photon imaging experiments, hippocampus slices were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 30 min and then allowed to reach room temperature gradually before being used for experiments over a period of several hours. For the cortical imaging experiments, slices were kept at 34 &#x000b0;C for the duration of the experiment.

Synaptic transmission was blocked in some experiments by the addition of 40 &#x003bc;M 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and 100 &#x003bc;M 2-amino-5-phosphovaleric acid.</p></sec><sec id="s4a8"><title>Imaging and analysis in cortical and hippocampal slices</title><p>Wide-field images were taken with a MicroMax, 512 &#x000d7; 512 back-illuminated CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, Arizona, United States) binned 5 by 5. For experiments involving extracellular stimuli we calculated the change in fluorescence relative to the prestimulus period (&#x00394;F/F) for each binned pixel frame by frame. The prestimulus period of regions of interest was fitted with an exponential curve, which was then subtracted from the entire fluorescence time course to correct for bleaching. No corrections were made for autofluorescence, so that the relative FCIP fluorescence changes are likely to be larger. When analyzing action-potential-induced signals from individual neurons, we calculated the fluorescence changes by subtracting the average of two nearby areas from the total fluorescence to account for background fluorescence (the intracellular FCIP concentration may, however, have been reduced by dialysis into the recording pipette&#x02014;see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p><p>Two-photon image sequences were collected approximately 50 &#x003bc;m away from the stimulating electrode.

Image sequences were 6 or 12 s long. The background level (average intensity with the laser off) was subtracted from every frame in the image sequence. The average of the five prestimulus (rest) images was subtracted from the average of five &#x0201c;response&#x0201d; images (response minus rest). The built-in smoothing function of ImageJ was used to reduce the noise further. The brightness of the difference image was enhanced for better display. Localized small fluorescent structures or hot spots in neurites were identified visually. For IP, traces with high time resolution were acquired using 64-pixel line scans at 500 Hz. Fluorescence was averaged over the width of the soma. The fluorescence from a neighboring region was subtracted to account for background.
