<article-title>Reconstructing Neural Circuits in 3D, Nanometer by Nanometer</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Three-dimensional (3D) structural information on many length scales is of central importance in biological research. Excellent methods exist to obtain structures of molecules at atomic, organelles at electron microscopic, and tissue at light-microscopic resolution. A gap exists, however, when 3D tissue structure needs to be reconstructed over hundreds of micrometers with a resolution sufficient to follow the thinnest cellular processes and to identify small organelles such as synaptic vesicles. Such 3D data are, however, essential to understand cellular networks that, particularly in the nervous system, need to be completely reconstructed throughout a substantial spatial volume. Here we demonstrate that datasets meeting these requirements can be obtained by automated block-face imaging combined with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Backscattering contrast is used to visualize the heavy-metal staining of tissue prepared using techniques that are routine for transmission electron microscopy. Low-vacuum (20&#x02013;60 Pa H<sub>2</sub>O) conditions prevent charging of the uncoated block face. The resolution is sufficient to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify synapses. Stacks of several hundred sections, 50&#x02013;70 nm thick, have been obtained at a lateral position jitter of typically under 10 nm. This opens the possibility of automatically obtaining the electron-microscope-level 3D datasets needed to completely reconstruct the connectivity of neuronal circuits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A new method combines automated imaging with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many cellular structures are so small that they can only be resolved in the electron microscope. Furthermore, it is often crucial to visualize and reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) structure of biological tissue. One prime example of where 3D information is indispensable is in exploring the connectivity of local networks of neurons. While axonal and dendritic processes have been traced using the light microscope from the very beginning of cellular neuroscience (Cajal 1911), light microscopic tracing is only possible if staining is restricted to a small subset of cells, as results, for example, from the Golgi method (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Golgi1" ref-type="bibr">Golgi 1873</xref>) or from the mosaic expression of fluorescent proteins (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al. 2000</xref>). However, in many cases, in order to understand computational algorithms, the reconstruction of a complete neural circuit may be necessary. For this, the resolution of the light microscope is insufficient because dendritic and axonal processes can have diameters that are substantially below the wavelength of light. This lack of resolution (1) results in the inability to resolve densely packed neighboring processes, which is absolutely necessary to reconstruct network topology, and (2) does not allow a sufficiently precise estimation of the neuronal geometry, which may be necessary for biophysical modeling of cellular behavior. So far, only the electron microscope (EM) can provide the spatial resolution needed to track neural processes or to identify synapses unambiguously. Most commonly used to image biological tissue is the transmission electron microscope (TEM) (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Ruska1" ref-type="bibr">Ruska and Knoll 1932</xref>), in which a broad beam of electrons is directed at a sample that is thin enough to allow a substantial fraction of the electrons to pass through and then be focused onto film or another electron-sensitive spatially resolving detector. Specimens are typically thin slices that are cut from blocks of plastic-embedded tissue, with the resulting electron micrographs providing a two-dimensional cross section through the tissue. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Ardenne1" ref-type="bibr">Ardenne 1938a</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Ardenne2" ref-type="bibr">1938b</xref>), in which a tightly focused beam of electrons is raster-scanned over the specimen while secondary or backscattered electrons are detected, is used in biological imaging mostly as a surface visualization tool, creating a 3D appearance but no actual 3D datasets.</p><p>Truly 3D information in the TEM can be obtained using either tilt-series-based tomography (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Hoppe1" ref-type="bibr">Hoppe 1981</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">Frank 1992</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Baumeister1" ref-type="bibr">Baumeister 2002</xref>) or serial ultrathin sections (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Sjostrand1" ref-type="bibr">Sjostrand 1958</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Ware1" ref-type="bibr">Ware and Lopresti 1975</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al. 1980</xref>). Tomography is a very promising technique for obtaining high-resolution structural data of macromolecules, organelles, and small cells but may not be applicable when larger volumes need to be reconstructed, because section thickness is limited to around 1 &#x003bc;m. In the high-voltage EM, somewhat thicker sections can be viewed, which facilitates the correlation with light microcopy (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Martone1" ref-type="bibr">Martone et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>Serial-sectioning TEM, which can be used to obtain 3D data of much thicker volumes than is possible with tomography, is a mostly mature technology and has contributed enormously to our understanding of the local 3D ultrastructure, for example of dendritic spines (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">Harris 1999</xref>). A whole animal, the nematode <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> has been reconstructed in this way (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-White1" ref-type="bibr">White et al. 1986</xref>). This is still considered a seminal effort, partly because serial sectioning is such a labor-intensive and time-consuming method, which requires intensive operator involvement in cutting sections, gathering data, and reconstructing volumes. The number of sections that need to be handled can be reduced by combining tomography with serial sectioning (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Soto1" ref-type="bibr">Soto et al. 1994</xref>), but the need to manually handle the sections remains. For these reasons the number of larger-scale 3D serial reconstructions has been rather limited, even though many biological problems, not only the tracing of neural circuits, require truly 3D information.</p><p>Volume information equivalent to that from reconstructing serial sections can, of course, be obtained if the sections are imaged before being cut, that is, by repeatedly imaging the block face. Block-face imaging is used even in light microscopy (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Odgaard1" ref-type="bibr">Odgaard et al. 1990</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Ewald1" ref-type="bibr">Ewald et al. 2002</xref>), where optical-sectioning techniques, such as confocal (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Minski1" ref-type="bibr">Minski 1961</xref>) or multi-photon microcopy (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Denk1" ref-type="bibr">Denk et al. 1990</xref>), are readily available. It is, of course, impossible to image the block face in the TEM. The SEM, as a surface-imaging technique, is, on the other hand, well suited for this task. This was recognized several decades ago by Leighton, who also constructed a microtome for cutting sections inside the microscope chamber (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Leighton1" ref-type="bibr">Leighton 1981</xref>). Imaging the block face removes not only the need to deal manually with ribbons of fragile sections but also the difficulty of aligning the images of sections, which are often distorted. The prevalent contrast mode in the SEM is the detection of so-called secondary electrons, which are low-energy electrons that are emitted when the primary electron beam strikes the sample surface. The secondary-electron signal depends strongly on the orientation of the surface, leading to topographic images that characteristically resemble obliquely illuminated solid objects. Since the microtome-cut block surface is devoid of topographic features, very little contrast is generated unless an additional preparatory step, such a plasma etching (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Kuzirian1" ref-type="bibr">Kuzirian and Leighton 1983</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Hukui1" ref-type="bibr">Hukui 1996</xref>), is used.</p><p>At the time of Leighton's original work, no stacks of volumetric data were presented. One reason might have been that low-vacuum SEMs (also called atmospheric [<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">Robinson 1975</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Danilatos1" ref-type="bibr">Danilatos 1980</xref>] or environmental SEMs; for a recent review see <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Donald1" ref-type="bibr">Donald [2003]</xref>), which can be used to image nonconducting specimens (see below), were not widely available. In the original report (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Leighton1" ref-type="bibr">Leighton 1981</xref>), the sample had to be removed from the SEM chamber for coating with a conducting layer. Furthermore, digital image acquisition, storage, and processing were in their infancy and quite limited in capacity.</p><p>In this paper we show, first, that by using backscattering contrast and low-vacuum operation we can obtain high-contrast images from cut block faces and, second, that in combination with a custom-designed microtome we can obtain 3D ultrastructural data with a resolution and from volumes appropriate for the 3D reconstruction of local neural circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>As a first step, we explored whether sufficient contrast and stable images can be obtained from uncoated block faces of plastic-embedded tissue, prepared essentially as for TEM. There are a number of techniques known that allow imaging of nonconducting specimens in the SEM. One technique relies on choosing an accelerating voltage at which the introduction of charge by the electron beam is just balanced by the sum of backscattered and secondary electrons (for a review see <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Joy1" ref-type="bibr">Joy and Joy [1996]</xref>). We first tried the charge-balance method (electron energies around 600 eV) but found that the secondary-electron signal provides, not surprisingly, unsatisfactory contrast (data not shown). The secondary-electron signal is the only contrast available because low-energy backscattered electrons (BSEs) cannot be easily detected at such low voltages. Furthermore, residual charging, which may not be strong enough to preclude the formation of an image, can still lead to slight shifts between images by electrostatic beam deflection. This then destroys the alignment between successive images, which is one of the main reasons to establish serial block-face imaging.</p><p>Another set of techniques relies on providing ions in the specimen chamber to neutralize charge on the sample rather than avoiding net charge introduction by the electron beam. This can, for example, be achieved by maintaining a low concentration of gas in the chamber (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">Robinson 1975</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Moncrieff1" ref-type="bibr">Moncrieff et al. 1978</xref>) at a pressure (10&#x02013;100 Pa) that is low enough for a substantial fraction of the beam's electrons to reach the sample unscattered and thus be able to form a tight focus. Ions needed for discharging the sample are generated by those electrons that do strike gas molecules or atoms.</p><p>The residual-gas method (also called low-vacuum or variable-pressure mode) can be used at higher accelerating voltages and is, therefore, compatible with BSE contrast. Since scattering of electrons is strongly dependent on the charge of the atomic nucleus, the BSE signal provides a clear distinction between heavy-metal-stained and unstained structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">S1</xref>) that, after contrast reversal, look very similar to traditional transmission electron micrographs. Images of uncoated block faces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figure 1</xref>) resemble scanning electron micrographs obtained from block faces of similar specimens coated with a very thin conducting film and imaged under high-vacuum conditions (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">Richards and ap Gwynn 1996</xref>). Our BSE images also demonstrate that the resolution under these conditions is sufficient to resolve structures such as synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) or the array of actin filaments characteristic of skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Synaptic contacts in cortical tissue can be clearly identified as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">1</xref>E).</p><fig id="pbio-0020329-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Resolution and Contrast Using the Backscattered Electron Signal</title><p>(A and B) Presynaptic vesicles (SV) and postsynaptic folds (SF) are clearly visible (A) in a motor endplate preparation embedded in Spurr's resin.

On this basis we decided to construct an ultra-microtome appropriate for sequential sectioning inside the sample chamber of an SEM. There are a number of special requirements for such a microtome. (1) The position of the block has to remain stable or be returned to the same location after each image is taken in order to ensure alignment of subsequent images, which is one of the primary objectives of serial block-face imaging. (2) The distance between the block face and the SEM objective lens has to be sufficiently small to allow high-resolution imaging and the efficient collection of backscattered electrons under low-vacuum conditions. (3) The block face has to be perpendicular to the optical axis of the electron optical column to keep the whole block face in focus; for all commercial SEM instruments this means horizontal orientation. (4) The operation of the microtome must be remotely controllable to allow automation. (5) The microtome has to be compatible with low vacuum. Finally, (6) the range of the fine advance mechanism has to be at least several hundred microns to permit continuous sectioning of volumes large enough to be of interest in the study of local neuronal circuits. Conditions 1, 2, and 3 rule out the modification of a conventional ultra-microtome, in which the sample block, its face oriented vertically, is moved against a stationary knife. Condition 2, in addition, rules out the use of a conventionally mounted diamond knife, since the boat would protrude upwards, colliding with the BSE detector and even with the objective lens.</p><p>We, therefore, decided to construct a microtome de novo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g002">Figure 2</xref>; for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), which does share some design features with the instrument built by <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Leighton1" ref-type="bibr">Leighton (1981)</xref>. A custom knife that could fit under the detector was designed in cooperation with the Diatome company and fabricated by Diatome. To meet condition 1 above, the knife is moved for cutting. In the z-direction, sample advance rather than knife advance is used in order to keep the cutting plane, and hence the location of the block surface, constant. This removes the need for refocusing the SEM, thereby contributing to image stability and registration. To avoid sliding friction, crossed leave flexures were used for the knife arm and for the sample advance mechanism. To provide advance motion with sufficiently fine resolution, we used a lever mechanism that scaled the motion of a motorized micrometer down by a factor of roughly 1/9. To minimize heat production, which can lead to thermal drift and is hard to dissipate in vacuum, we used a direct-current motor drive.</p><fig id="pbio-0020329-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>SEM Microtomy</title><p>(A) Principle of SBFSEM operation: (1) a SEM image is taken of the surface of the plastic-embedded tissue preparation (amber trapezoid). (2) Then with a diamond knife (blue) an ultrathin slice is cut off the top of the block. (3) After retraction of the knife, the next picture is taken. The pictures shown are from an actual stack (cerebellar cortex) but are not successive slices; rather, they are spaced by five images (about 315 nm) to make the changes more apparent.</p><p>(B) Usually cut-off slices pile up on the top of the knife.

Since SBFSEM does not allow contrast enhancement after cutting, which is often used in the TEM, we tested several methods of enhancing the contrast of the whole block and found that exposing the tissue to uranyl acetate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and also <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Hayat1" ref-type="bibr">Hayat [2000]</xref>, p. 342ff) leads to excellent contrast in BSE mode (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We could reliably cut serial sections thicker than about 50 nm, the exact lower thickness limit depending on the embedding material and the beam exposure (an upper thickness limit was not established). When trying to cut thinner sections the actual thickness became uneven or the knife would skip every other cut, as recognized by the lack of change in structural detail. Another indication of uneven cutting is alternating brightness of the whole images or image regions. The reason for this is that the backscattering efficiency generally increases after beam exposure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), which may be because a selective ablation of the embedding matrix leads to an effective increase in the heavy-metal concentration.</p><p>Usually the cut-off slices pile up on the top surface of the knife (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Only rarely does a sliver get deposited on the block surface. When this happens it results in the loss of only one image since the sliver is reliably removed by the next passage of the knife. During the cutting of the stack used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g003">3</xref>B, three instances of deposited debris occurred (white horizontal streaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Currently efforts are underway to devise methods (such as using a brief puff of gas from a glass pipette, such as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) to reliably remove the debris from the knife after each cut.</p><fig id="pbio-0020329-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>3D Datasets: Five Slices</title><p>(A) Five slices from a stack containing a total of 365 slices at 63-nm section thickness; same tissue as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">1</xref>B.

[2003]</xref>). For our early experiments we had used the electron energy of 7.5 keV because lower voltages gave unsatisfactory signals. At 7.5 keV the resolution along the z-axis is not very good, as is apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g003">Figure 3</xref>D. To improve the z-resolution one could conceivably use deconvolution techniques because the point spread function contains a sharp edge and hence high spatial frequencies along the z-axis, even if the electron penetration into the sample is large. The reason is that while a structural detail can contribute to the signal if buried in the sample, the contribution from that detail drops immediately to zero as soon as the slice containing the detail is removed.</p><p>Electron penetration depends strongly (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Kanaya1" ref-type="bibr">Kanaya and Okayama 1972</xref>) on the energy (scaling as <italic>E</italic>
<sup>1.67</sup>). This means, for example, that at 4 keV the depth is reduced to about one-third of that at 7.5 keV. The actual value for the depth penetration is difficult to estimate for a composite material such as plastic-embedded heavy-metal-stained tissue. For a detailed discussion of the issues surrounding depth penetration see, for example, chapter 3 of <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Goldstein1" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein et al. (2003)</xref>. We, therefore, decided to operate the SBFESM at lower voltages. In order to obtain sufficient signal at the lower electron energy, where the efficiency of semiconductor-diode BSE detectors declines steeply (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Funsten1" ref-type="bibr">Funsten et al. 1997</xref>), we replaced the detector amplifier with an instrument originally designed to detect single ion-channel currents (commonly called a patch-clamp amplifier [<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Hamill1" ref-type="bibr">Hamill et al. 1981</xref>]) and found that we could now get satisfactory images for electron energies of 4 keV. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g005">Figure 5</xref> the depth resolutions at 7.5 and 4 keV are directly compared for the same sample. It is particularly encouraging that at 4 keV it is possible to recognize clearly membranes that are parallel to the block surface (en-face membranes), which is crucial for the successful reconstruction of cellular topology.</p><fig id="pbio-0020329-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Energy Dependence of the Depth Resolution</title><p>The lateral resolution does not change very much as the electron energy is reduced from 7.5 keV (A) to 4 keV (B), but the resolution along the z-direction is dramatically different (C).

The lateral resolution is sufficient to recognize most cellular organelles and synaptic specializations and does not appear to be limited by the beam spot diameter but by the spread of the beam in the sample (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Kanaya1" ref-type="bibr">Kanaya and Okayama 1972</xref>; see also <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Joy1" ref-type="bibr">Joy and Joy 1996</xref>). This spread could be further reduced by using lower beam energies, provided that more sensitive detectors for such low electron energies can be obtained (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Funsten1" ref-type="bibr">Funsten et al. 1997</xref>). Lower beam energies also would further improve the z-resolution, even though at some point elemental contrast in the BSE signal begins to decline (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Joy1" ref-type="bibr">Joy and Joy 1996</xref>). The resolution is, in practice, also limited by the radiation dose that a specimen can sustain. Since at lower electron energies the beam's energy is deposited into a rapidly shrinking volume, heating effects could become an issue. Nonetheless, it appears conceivable that nearly isotropic resolution can be achieved if the sectioning thickness can be reduced to around 20 nm (see below), with imaging then done at primary electron energies of around 2 keV. Because the registration between successive slices (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g004">Figure 4</xref>) is mostly better than the resolution, the 3D data stacks can be used without further alignment and distortion correction (for the complete set of raw data see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Datasets S1&#x02013;S20</xref>; slices through this dataset are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figures S2&#x02013;S4</xref>) . This is crucial if automated reconstruction is to be performed, since alignment of serial sections often requires manually identified landmarks.</p><p>It would be highly desirable to reliably cut sections thinner than 50 nm, which appears to be the current limit in our hands. The exact reason for this thickness limit is not clear as yet. Much thinner sections have been cut from plastic blocks (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Frosch1" ref-type="bibr">Frosch et al. 1985</xref>), albeit under atmospheric pressure with the sections floated onto water. An important difference between standard ultra-microtomy and SBFSEM is that, because of the inevitable exposure of the block face to the electron beam, the mechanical properties of the block surface are changed, affecting cutting of subsequent sections. While at very high doses these effects are deleterious, they can be helpful at intermediate levels for suppressing chatter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). To suppress chatter and to achieve thinner sectioning, we have begun to use the oscillating-knife technique (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Studer1" ref-type="bibr">Studer and Gnaegi 2000</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020329-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd002">S2&#x02013;S4</xref>). It might also help to reduce the sample temperature, which, in addition to affecting cutting properties directly by changing the polymer stiffness, might substantially improve the resistance to radiation damage (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Lamvik1" ref-type="bibr">Lamvik 1991</xref>). SBFSEM might ultimately allow a smaller section thickness than is routinely possible with serial sectioning for the TEM, since there the mechanical integrity of the cut sections has to be ensured. Alternatively, one might use nonmechanical surface-ablation techniques such as plasma etching, reactive or focused ion beam etching, or ion milling to achieve smaller depth increments. Nonmechanical techniques do, however, suffer from a dependence of the ablation rate on the composition, which is, by the very nature of embedded tissue, rather inhomogeneous.</p><p>In spite of the similarity in appearance, it is important to keep in mind a number of differences between transmission imaging of sections and backscattered SBFSEM. First, in the SEM, a large fraction of the entire beam energy is deposited inside the sample, leading to much increased radiation damage per primary electron. This is partly counteracted by the fact that BSE imaging is a &#x0201c;dark field&#x0201d; technique and, therefore, each detected electron carries more information. Furthermore, because the primary-electron energies can be lower by a large factor in the SEM (4 keV) than in the TEM (typically about 80 keV but routinely as high as 300 keV and up to 3 MeV in special cases), scattering cross sections are much larger in the SEM. This may, however, not always translate into improved contrast, since in the SEM only electrons scattered by angles larger than 90&#x000b0; can contribute to the image, while rather small deflections are enough to remove an electron from the beam in the TEM. A major practical advantage of SEM block-face imaging is that there is no need to manually handle sections, and no occlusion occurs by EM-grid bars. On the other hand, it is, unlike in TEM, impossible to reimage a section at higher resolution. Finally, it is unlikely that SEM surface imaging will ever reach the lateral resolution that can be achieved by imaging thin sections in the TEM.</p><p>The total volume that can be reconstructed by SBFSEM is currently limited in the lateral dimension by the digital resolution available on commercial SEM instruments. It should, however, be straightforward to increase the digital resolution by modifying the scan and data-collection cir-cuitry. Eventually, off-axis electron-optical aberrations will become significant, but the total field of view can then be increased by mechanical translation of the microtome and tiling of multiple images. In the z-direction the stack height that can be cut continuously is, first, limited by the travel of the fine advance. Second, and more fundamentally, the cutting pyramid becomes unstable and too compliant if it is too high. However, a single step of image realignment after retrimming and repositioning will allow the continuation in the z-direction for almost unlimited distances.</p><p>A major practical limitation is, of course, the acquisition speed of the SEM, which is ultimately dependent on the required signal-to-noise ratio <italic>(R<sub>SN</sub>).</italic> We can estimate the minimally achievable voxel dwell time <italic>(&#x003c4;<sub>d</sub>)</italic> using the backscattering coefficient (&#x003b7;) as follows:</p><p>

The available beam current depends on the electron-gun type, the desired resolution, and the electron energy, but a value of <italic>I<sub>B</sub></italic> = 1 nA is realistic for our purposes. We set &#x003b7; to 0.1, which is the value for carbon and thus a lower limit since backscattering is, of course, higher for the heavy-metal-stained areas (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Drescher1" ref-type="bibr">Drescher et al. 1970</xref>; see also chapter 3 in <xref rid="pbio-0020329-Goldstein1" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein et al. [2003]</xref>). To get <italic>R<sub>SN</sub></italic> =100 we then need a dwell time of 16 &#x003bc;s, allowing data rates slightly above 50,000 voxels/s. A cube 200 &#x003bc;m on a side imaged at a resolution of 10 nm &#x000d7; 10 nm &#x000d7; 50 nm, which corresponds to 1.6 teravoxels, would then require a total scan time of 25,600,000 s, which is on the order of one year. However, the tracing of axons probably can, with the appropriate staining, be achieved at 20-nm lateral resolution and with an <italic>R<sub>SN</sub></italic> of ten or less. This reduces the estimated time by a factor of 400, to less than one day. While in some cases the resolution provided by conventional (tungsten filament) electron guns may be sufficient, we feel that the long-term stability of field-emission emitters is essential for imaging large volumes.</p><p>The approach described here will speed up the collection of medium-to-high resolution 3D electron microscopic datasets by several orders of magnitude. The acquired data will, in addition, not require time-consuming and error-prone alignment and distortion correction. This should have wide-ranging applications not only in biomedical research but also in materials characterization (<xref rid="pbio-0020329-Alkemper1" ref-type="bibr">Alkemper and Voorhees 2001</xref>).

This requires the imaging of volumes containing at least one complete dendritic tree and is therefore virtually impossible using conventional electron microscopic methods. The data quality using current staining techniques is good enough to manually trace neuronal processes in many cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>).
