Fifteen patients fullfilling the inclusion criteria (stage IIIB and IV, HLA-A1<sup>+</sup>, or -B35<sup>+ </sup>and HLA-DPO4<sup>+ </sup>leukocyte phenotype, tumor expressing MAGE3 antigen) were enrolled from 2000 to 2002 and received four exosome vaccinations.

In preclinical studies, few vaccination strategies were shown to counteract tumor induced-tolerance and to promote immunity to cancer leading to tumor eradication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One of the most promising approach recently developped is based on the adoptive transfer of mature dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with tumor peptides and control antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Dhodapkar et al. performed a pionnering clinical trial demonstrating the rapid generation of T cell immunity against recall antigens and Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin in normal volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and Sch&#x000fc;ler-Thurner et al. successfully promoted active, melanoma peptide-specific, IFN&#x003b3; producing, effector CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and helper CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th1 lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] in the majority of patients with metastatic melanoma. If a single injection of CD34+ progenitor derived-DC vaccine can lead to induction of T cell immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], correlations between clinical responses and CTL Tc1/CD4<sup>+ </sup>Th1 activation have been rarely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that antigen spreading initiated by the specific T cells and/or intervention of alternate effectors also elicited by mature DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] might account for this apparent discrepancy.</p><p>DC process exogenous antigens in endosomal compartments such as multivesicular endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] which can fuse with plasma membrane, thereby releasing antigen presenting vesicles called &#x000ab;exosomes&#x000bb; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Exosomes are 50&#x02013;90 nm diameter vesicles containing antigen presenting molecules (MHC class I, class II, CD1, hsp70&#x02013;90) tetraspan molecules (CD9, CD63, CD81), adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD54) and CD86 costimulatory molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] i.e the necessary machinery required for generating potent immune responses. Exosomal MHC class I and II /peptide complexes are functional but require to be transferred to naive DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] to promote T cell activation leading to tumor eradication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Exosomes pulsed with tumor peptides are more efficient than peptides alone and as efficient as mature DC for the priming of MART1 -specific CTL and for tumor growth inhibition in the HLA-A2 transgenic mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The molecular characterization of DC derived-exosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and the definition of quality control parameters for exosome purification and storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] allowed to conduct a Phase I clinical trial aimed at evaluating the feasability of exosome harvesting from autologous monocyte derived-DC cultures and the safety of exosome inoculation in melanoma patients. Secondary endpoints were the immunomonitoring of peptide specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cell responses restricted by exosomal MHC class II and I molecules respectively. Up to 41 &#x000b1; 6.7 (9&#x02013;115) id/sc vaccinations/patient at the lowest dosage (i.e 0.13 &#x000d7; 10<sup>14 </sup>exosomal MHC class II molecules /vaccine) could be generated for all patients from one leukapheresis. One partial response and some other tumor regressions at skin and lymph node sites even in tumors that did not respond to other vaccine formulations were observed in the absence of toxicity. A case report of MART1 antigen spreading and MHC class I loss variant suggested that exosomes mediated bioactivity in vivo, supporting to conduct Phase II clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients, Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Protocol design, Patients' characteristics and eligibility criteria</title><p>We report here about the first phase I trial (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) which administers 4 exosome vaccinations intradermally and subcutaneously at 1 week intervals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee, local IRBs and regulatory authorities, and informed written consent was given by all patients. The authors were in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Fifteen patients bearing melanoma fullfilling the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Inclusion criteria were: biopsy-proven American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IIIB and IV metastatic melanoma, HLA-A1<sup>+</sup>, or -B35<sup>+ </sup>and HLA-DPO4<sup>+ </sup>phenotype (as defined by serological and molecular typing), tumor expressing MAGE3 antigen (assessed by RT-PCR, as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]), inclusion at least 4 weeks after cytotoxic chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation therapy, intradermal skin test positivity to one or more recall antigens using Pasteur M&#x000e9;rieux multi DTH test, age &#x0003e; 18 years, Karnofsky performans status &#x0003e;80%, lymphocyte counts &#x0003e;1000 /mm<sup>3</sup>. Exclusion criteria were: prior chemotherapy or biotherapies &#x0003c;4 weeks before trial entry, brain metastasis, pregnancy, concurrent steroids or immunosuppressive therapy, history of asthma, congestive heart failure, autoimmune disease, active infections. Three patients presenting with skin or LN involved sites declined conventional therapies and received exosomes upfront (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Patients received a 4 week outpatient vaccination course with antigen loaded DC derived-exosomes given intradermally (1/10<sup>th</sup>) and subcutaneously (9/10<sup>th</sup>) every week for a total of 4 vaccinations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The injection sites were rotating between both thighs and forearms. The study was scheduled in two steps i.e 1) MHC class I peptide loading was &#x000ab;indirectly&#x000bb; performed on the DC culture at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml, and 2) MHC class I peptide loading was &#x000ab;directly&#x000bb; performed onto purified and acid eluted exosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Indeed, our preclinical studies aimed at comparing the exosome immunogenicity after indirect versus direct peptide loading showed a superiority of the latter process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Exosomes (quantified as concentrations of MHC class II molecules, see below) or peptides that were pulsed onto exosomes were administered in a dose escalation design. In the first step, 0.13 or 0.40 &#x000d7; 10<sup>14 </sup>MHC class II molecules were inoculated in a cohort of three patients each. In the second step, the concentration of peptide loading onto exosomes varied from 10 &#x003bc;g/ml to 100 &#x003bc;g/ml in a cohort of 3 and 6 patients respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study design</bold>.

The antitumor effects did not correlate with an enhanced frequency of MAGE3 specific CTL precursors as demonstrated using microculture detection assays after the first 4 vaccines or after the continuation treatment (not shown).

From a single leukapheresis, up to 10<sup>14</sup>-10<sup>15 </sup>exosomal MHC class II molecules could be purified in GMP conditions for all patients, allowing 9&#x02013;123 sc/id vaccinations with 0.13 &#x000d7; 10<sup>14 </sup>exosomal MHC class II molecules. The optimal dosages of exosomal MHC class II molecules required to trigger an efficient peptide-specific CTL response leading to tumor rejection was about 10<sup>10</sup>-10<sup>11 </sup>molecules in preclinical studies in the HLA-A2 transgenic mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The optimal method for pulsing exosomal MHC class I molecules with peptides was a direct loading after acid elution of the exosomal pellet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A dose response was observed in vitro, prompting the use of 100 ug/ml for peptide pulsing onto GMP exosomes. As to MHC class II associated-peptide loading, pulsing immature day 5 DC with 10 ug/ml was optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, in this Phase I study, since no untoward clinical effect nor pharmacodynamic parameter appear to be dose-dependent, neither the peptide pulsing method nor the dosage of exosomes or peptides could help defining the maximal tolerated doses of exosomes. Interestingly, in the second Phase I trial initiated at the Dukes' University in unresectable lung carcinoma, there was a trend for a better efficacy of exosomes directly pulsed with MHC class I peptides in long term survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Only one objective response (PR) according to the RECIST criteria was recorded. However, one minor response and two stabilisations prompted the continuation of treatment as well. Tumor regression was exclusively observed in skin and lymph node lesions, as already reported for peptide-based vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is noteworthy that three of these patients had primarily resisted to alternate immunotherapy strategies (i.e IFN type I, ALVAC-Mage 3, Mage 3 protein) but it is also likely that such immunomodulators might have facilitated exosome efficacy. However, we were not able to detect significant Mage 3 specific CTL precursors in peripheral blood (nor lymph nodes and lesions) after exosome vaccination. Notewithstanding, MHC class I tumor loss variant and naevi depigmentation was observed in one case (pt #12), suggesting melanoma antigen spreading mediated by HLA-A2-restricted CTL cells. It is conceivable that the Mart1-specific CTL monitored in blood and in LN TIL could have mediated part of these antitumor effects.</p><p>No DTH responses to iterative inoculations of exosomes or MHC class II restricted-direct or recall responses (to TT epitopes (3 pts tested), or Mage DP04 epitopes (12 patients tested)) were detected at 4 and 6 weeks of exosome vaccination. It is noteworthy that peptides and not whole proteins (such as TT or KLH) were used to pulse DC in vitro, in contrast to what has been reported in most DC trials. However, in the transgenic Marilyn mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], id inoculation of I-A<sup>b </sup>harboring exosomes pulsed with H-Y epitopes could promote expansion of peptide specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>transgenic T cells. Nevertheless, MHC class I restricted-CTL responses elicited by exosomes pulsed with Mart1 peptides in HLA-A2 transgenic mice were dramatically boosted by adjuvants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that injection of exosomes in the area of an inflammatory draining lymph node harboring mature APC might promote elicitation of T cell immune responses leading to tumor regressions in patients. Alternatively, we recently showed that regulatory C4+CD25+ T cells (Treg) restrict T cell responses elicited by DC derived-exosomes (Chaput et al, in preparation). Therefore, high yields of Treg at start might severely impair the efficacy of exosomes to prime or boost T cell responses. Supporting this view, our unpublished data demonstrate synergistic T cell dependent-antitumor effects between peptide pulsed-exosomes and immunopotentiating dosing of cyclophosphamide.</p><p>Since no specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells generated by the exosome vaccines could be detected and could account for the tumor regression in patient#12, what could have been the primary effectors accounting for antigen spreading? We were able to show enhanced NK cell effector functions following exosome administration in peripheral blood of 8/13 patients including patient #12 for whom CD3-CD57+ cells expressing PEN5 (mostly expressed on CD56<sup>dim </sup>NK cells) were markedly infiltrating the tumor after therapy (N. Chaput, manuscript in preparation). Therefore, it is conceivable that DC derived-exosomes from melanoma patients are specifically endowed with NK cell stimulatory capacity in vivo. This hypothesis deserves further investigations and should be pursued in the next clinical studies. Moreover, since our preclinical data in tumor bearing mice highlighted a critical role of suppressor T cells in restricting exosome-mediated specific T cell responses, T regulatory cells should be monitored and combination of cyclophosphamide together with exosomes could be invisioned (N.
