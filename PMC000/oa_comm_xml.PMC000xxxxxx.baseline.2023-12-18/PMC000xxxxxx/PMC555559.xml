In rodent models, the protective effect of pregnancy can be mimicked with a defined regimen of estrogen and progesterone combination (E/P). However, the effects of pregnancy levels of E/P in humans and their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this report, we investigated the growth inhibitory effects of pregnancy levels of E/P and both natural and synthetic retinoids in an immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line, 76N TERT cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We observed that cell growth was modestly inhibited by E/P, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis RA) or all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), and strongly inhibited by N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (HPR). The growth inhibitory effects of retinoids were further increased in the presence of E/P, suggesting their effects are additive. In addition, our results showed that both E/P and retinoid treatments resulted in increased <italic>RARE </italic>and <italic>p53 </italic>gene activity. We further demonstrated that p53 and p21 protein expression were induced following the E/P and retinoid treatments. Furthermore, we demonstrated that while the telomerase activity was moderately inhibited by E/P, 9-cis RA and ATRA, it was almost completely abolished by HPR treatment. These inhibitions on telomerase activity by retinoids were potentiated by co-treatment with E/P, and correlated well with their observed growth inhibitory effects. Finally, this study provides the first evidence that estrogen receptor beta is up-regulated in response to E/P and retinoid treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our studies show that part of the anti-growth effects of E/P and retinoids is p53 dependent, and involve activation of <italic>p53 </italic>and subsequent induction of p21 expression. Inhibition of telomerase activity and up-regulation of estrogen receptor beta are also associated with the E/P- and retinoid-mediated growth inhibition. Our studies also demonstrate that the potency of retinoids on cell growth inhibition may be increased through combination of estrogen and progesterone treatment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>It is well documented that women who experience a full-term pregnancy early in their lives have a significantly reduced risk for developing breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms by which pregnancy affects maternal breast cancer incidences are not fully understood. Previous studies suggest that the protective effect of pregnancy can be mimicked with a defined regimen of estrogen and progesterone combination (E/P) in rodent models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the effects of pregnancy levels of E/P in human and their underlying mechanisms have not been investigated.</p><p>Retinoids are a promising class of chemopreventive agents against breast cancer because of their antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are nuclear transcription factors that modulate the biological effects of retinoids. Most retinoid forms, including 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis RA) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), activate RAR family members, whereas RXR family members are activated by 9-cis RA. N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (HPR), a synthetic derivative of ATRA, may weakly interact with retinoid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The 76N TERT cells were derived from a reduction mammoplasty specimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. They are normal human mammary epithelial cells immortalized by plasmids containing hTERT, the human catalytic subunit of the reverse transcriptase protein of telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. hTERT-expressing normal cell clones have been shown to have an extended life span without any change in karyotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The 76N TERT cells in culture could continuously grow about 60 population doublings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and the level of p53 protein has been shown to remain consistent at early or late passages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Unlike the tumor cell lines widely used in breast cancer researches such as MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231 cells, which have undergone several steps in tumorigenesis, the 76N TERT cell line represents a system that is immortal but does not yet have the capacity to form a tumor. Hence, it is potentially a better model to study the genetic changes, and to test the effects of carcinogenic or chemopreventive agents on the development of mammary tumors.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether E/P induce growth inhibition in 76N TERT cells; and the molecular mechanisms by which E/P inhibited 76N TERT cell growth. For comparison purpose, the anti-growth effect of both natural and synthetic retinoids was examined in parallel in this immortalized mammary epithelial cell line. We also investigated whether we could increase the responsiveness of retinoids by using retinoids in combination with E/P. Our studies demonstrate that 1) inhibition of cell growth by E/P and retinoids could be partially mediated through a p53-dependent mechanism; 2) induction of p21 expression, inhibition of telomerase activity, or up-regulation of estrogen receptor beta (ER&#x003b2;) by E/P and retinoids may contribute to their anti-growth effects; 3) combination of retinoids with E/P lead to increased inhibitory effects on cell growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of RARs, RXRs, estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors in 76N TERT cells</title><p>As the ability of estrogen, progesterone and retinoids to influence cell proliferation is mediated by their respective receptors in most cases, we first examined the expression of these receptors in 76N TERT cells. Using Western blot analysis, the proteins of RAR (RAR&#x003b1;, RAR&#x003b2; and RAR&#x003b3;), RXR (RXR&#x003b1;, RXR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b3;), and ER (ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;) were observed as suggested by the manufactures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The antibody for the progesterone receptor (PR) detected a protein between 85 and 125 KDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The existences of RAR&#x003b2; and ER&#x003b2; in 76N TERT cells were further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR at the mRNA level (RAR&#x003b2; data not shown, ER&#x003b2; data see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of RAR, RXR, ER and PR in 76N TERT cells. </bold>Whole cell lysates were analyzed by using anti-RAR, RXR, ER, and PR antibodies as described under "Materials and Methods".

In the presence of E/P, the inhibitory effects on cell growth of 9-cis RA, ATRA and HPR were further increased to a respective 56.6%, 53.3% and 86.8%, indicating that the anti-proliferative effect may be additive between E/P and retinoids.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of 76N TERT cell growth by E/P and retinoids</bold>.

In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, exposure to retinoids or E/P alone did moderately increase the p21 protein level, with a 1.7-, 2.7- and 2.1-fold increase in p21 expression for ATRA, HPR and E/P respectively. The increases of p21 protein expression with combined E/P and retinoids were similar to that observed when E/P and retinoids were used alone.

To evaluate the effects of E/P and retinoids on telomerase activity in 76N TERT cells, cells were treated for different time periods with E/P and retinoids, and the levels of telomerase activity were determined by a quantitative real-time PCR method. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, treatment with E/P decreased telomerase activity in a time-dependent manner with a 63.3% inhibition at 72 hours, whereas vehicle treatment had no effect at any time during the experiment. The maximum inhibition on telomerase activity was observed at 24 hours for both 9-cis RA and ATRA treatments, with a respective of 68.9% and 69.4% decrease. In comparison, the effects of HPR occurred more rapidly, with a complete inhibition at 16 hours, and persisted throughout the treatment. The inhibitory effects of 9-cis RA, ATRA or HPR and E/P seemed to be additive, as in the presence of E/P, 9-cis RA, ATRA or HPR showed increased inhibitions at various time points. These effects correlate well with their observed growth inhibitory effects in 76N TERT cells, suggesting that inhibition of telomerase activity by E/P and retinoids may contribute to their additive effects on inhibition of cell growth.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of the telomerase activity by E/P and retinoids in 76N TERT cells</bold>.

We examined whether there were any changes in the expression of ER&#x003b2; in response to E/P and retinoid treatment in 76N TERT cells. After treatment of cells with retinoids or E/P for 72 hours, the amount of ER&#x003b2; protein was determined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, the normalized ER&#x003b2; protein showed a respective 2.1-, 2.3-, and 1.5-fold increase in response to ATRA, HPR and E/P, as compared to the vehicle treatment.</p><p>We also carried out a quantitative analysis of ER&#x003b2; mRNA expression in response to E/P and retinoid treatment in 76N TERT cells using a real-time PCR assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, there was a 2.0-, 2.3- or 2.8-fold induction of ER&#x003b2; mRNA levels in HPR, E/P or combination of HPR and E/P treated cells, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Similar to retinoids, a full-term pregnancy has been associated with beneficial effects on breast cancer risk over the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms by which pregnancy affects maternal breast cancer incidences are not fully understood. Studies have showed that higher concentrations of progesterone elicit a growth-inhibiting response from normal and cancerous breast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and are inversely related to breast cancer incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this study, we examined the ability of pregnancy levels of E/P and retinoids to affect the growth of the immortalized normal mammary epithelial cells. Our results demonstrated that three isoforms for RAR and RXR (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;), two isoforms for ER (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;), and PR receptor proteins are expressed by 76N TERT cells. Treatment with 9-cis RA, ATRA, HPR or E/P inhibited 76N TERT cell proliferation and resulted in the activation of <italic>p53 </italic>gene, followed by increased expression of p53 protein and p21 protein, and inhibition of telomerase activity. Additionally, we first report here that the expression of ER&#x003b2; is induced in response to E/P and retinoid treatment at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Importantly, we demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of retinoids on cell growth are more effective in the presence of E/P, and correlate well with their inhibitory effects on telomerase activity in 76N TERT cells.</p><p>Our data suggest that the growth inhibitory effects of E/P and retinoids may involve the activation of p53 pathway in 76N TERT cells. First, our results showed that both E/P and retinoid treatments lead to the increased <italic>p53 </italic>gene activity. Secondly, we demonstrated that the protein expression of p53 and p21 were increased following the treatment. It has been shown that p21 can inhibit cyclin A/cdk2 kinase activity and subsequently result in cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our data is in line with the previous findings that in normal mammary epithelial cells, retinoids induce cell cycle arrest which is associated with an increase in p21 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; and that in both rats and mice, <italic>p53 </italic>is activated in response to E/P and this activation is sustained to induce p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thirdly, our data showed that treatment with E/P or retinoids decreased the telomerase activity in 76N TERT cells. Although a few reports suggest that telomerase activity appears to be independent of <italic>p53 </italic>expression or mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the majority of the evidence to date support the involvement of <italic>p53 </italic>in regulation of telomerase activity in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms of regulation of telomerase activity by <italic>p53 </italic>may involve down-regulation of hTERT transcription or the interaction of <italic>p53 </italic>with other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>However, our data also suggest the possibility that inhibition of cell growth by E/P and retinoids may be independent of p53 pathway in 76N TERT cells. Our data show that the enhancing effects of retinoids on <italic>p53 </italic>gene activation or on the p53 and p21 protein expression were not further augmented by the addition of E/P, unlike their inhibitory effects on cell growth, indicating that other mechanisms besides the p53 pathway are likely to be involved. A p53-independent cell cycle arrest by retinoids has been previously suggested in a number of breast carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The p53-independent inhibitory effects of retinoids on cell growth can be exerted through various mechanisms including regulation of other genes that play critical roles in cell cycle progression such as c-myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], inhibition of activator protein mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], or induction of caspase-independent cell death via calcium and calpain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of E/P-mediated p53-independent cell growth inhibition are still unknown, and are currently under investigation using cell lines with different functional p53 systems.</p><p>Clearly, our data suggest that there are some overlaps between E/P- and retinoid-mediated growth inhibition in 76N TERT cells, considering that in response to E/P and retinoid treatments, same effectors such as <italic>RARE </italic>and <italic>p53 </italic>gene, p53 and p21 protein, and the telomerase activity were affected. Additionally, there also seems to be cross-talk between the E/P- and retinoid-mediated growth inhibition. Previous studies have suggested that there is cross-talk between ER&#x003b2; and RAR pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that the <italic>RARE </italic>gene activity was increased in response to E/P treatment. Furthermore, for the first time, we showed that treatment of immortal cells with E/P or retinoids could induce the expression of ER&#x003b2;, both at the mRNA and protein level. The expression of ER&#x003b2; often is found to be decreased markedly in the early stages of mammary carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Loss of ER&#x003b2; expression has been suggested as one of the events leading to the development of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our data may reveal another important mechanism by which E/P and retinoids produce their anticancer function, indicating ER&#x003b2; may represent a possible therapeutic target in breast cancer prevention.</p><p>More importantly, our data show that the growth-inhibitory effects of retinoids were potentiated by co-treatment with E/P in 76N TERT cells. These observations indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in E/P- and retinoid-mediated inhibition of cell growth. Our results of their differential inhibitory effects on telomerase activity may provide some explanation for this. Although E/P and all three retinoids inhibited telomerase activity, the time courses of their actions were different. While retinoids produced their maximal inhibitory effects around 16 to 24 hours after treatment, E/P required 72 hours to reach its maximal inhibition, suggesting different mediators may be utilized to decrease telomerase activity by E/P and retinoids. ATRA and 9-cis RA have been previously reported to inhibit cell growth and decrease telomerase activity through down-regulation of the expression of hTERT telomerase gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. On the other hand, progesterone treatment has been shown to down-regulate telomerase activity by modulation of cell cycle phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Previous studies have also provided evidence that the function of <italic>p53 </italic>in suppression of telomerase activity is separable from its cell cycle checkpoint function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that even though E/P and retinoids treatments both activate p53 pathway, they may use different mechanisms to inhibit telomerase activity. The different mediators involved in the inhibitory effects of E/P and retinoids on telomerase activity may contribute to their additive effects on inhibition of 76N TERT cell growth. The detailed mediator mechanisms down-stream of p53 and up-stream of telomerase activity for both E/P and retinoid pathways remain to be defined.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the mechanisms through which HPR regulates cell growth seem different than those by 9-cis RA and ATRA in 76N TERT cells. In the [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation experiments, our results showed that whereas only 25&#x02013;30% inhibition was observed for 9-cis RA and ATRA, 70% inhibition was reached by HPR. In addition, in the <italic>RARE</italic>-luciferase activity assay, 9-cis RA and ATRA induce about 3- to 5-fold activation on <italic>RARE </italic>gene activity. In contrast, HPR treatment resulted in no significant change. Finally, our data showed that 9-cis RA or ATRA treatment caused a moderate inhibitory effect on telomerase activity. In comparison, the telomerase activity is almost completely abolished by HPR treatment. The time courses of their inhibition of telomerase activity were different as well. While 9-cis RA and ATRA maximally inhibited the telomerase activity around 24 hours after treatment, HPR produced its maximal effect at 16 hours post-treatment. An obvious explanation for these different responses observed between 9-cis RA, ATRA and HPR is that these retinoids most likely possess different mechanisms for their actions. As suggested by numerous investigators, 9-cis RA and ATRA may function through the classical retinoid pathways involving the RARs and RXRs. On the other hand, in addition to activation the retinoid receptors [7a], HPR may also function through alternative pathways such as down-regulation of the IGF system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], activation of TGF-beta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], induction of genes which have antiproliferative activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], inhibition of aromatase activity and expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and involvement of cellular signals such as reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and the sphingolipid ceramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that 76N TERT cells express RAR, RXR, ER and PR, and represent a potential useful model to investigate the genetic changes, and the carcinogenic or chemopreventive effects of new agents on the development of mammary tumors. In addition, our data clearly suggest that part of the anti-growth effects of E/P is mediated through a p53-dependent pathway, as well as the involvement of the inhibition of telomerase activity and induction of ER&#x003b2;. Comparing the E/P- and retinoid-mediated inhibitory effects on cell growth, there are overlaps, cross-talks and distinct effectors between these pathways. Furthermore, our studies suggest that retinoids may be more effective when combined with E/P to prevent breast cancer development. This increased potency and sensitized response to retinoids with combined E/P treatment might have several important clinical implications for anti-cancer agents that mimic E/P effects. Firstly, it might allow the currently used RA regimens to show improved response in cancer prevention. Secondly, it may be sufficient to overcome some acquired or intrinsic RA resistance in cancer cells. Finally, it may lower the required does of either classes of anticancer agents used, leading to less side effects or toxicity. Overall, our studies better the understandings of the common and the unique mechanisms by which E/P and retinoids regulate cell growth, and may help us to design or to improve the clinical applications of anti-cancer agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>ATRA, 9-cis RA, HPR, &#x003b2;-estradiol and progesterone were all purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in ethanol.
