<article-title>Regulating the Regulators: Immune System Regulators Are Highly Susceptible to HIV Infection</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>A T-cell subset, defined as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> (regulatory T-cells [Treg cells]), was recently shown to suppress T-cell activation. We demonstrate that human Treg cells isolated from healthy donors express the HIV-coreceptor CCR5 and are highly susceptible to HIV infection and replication. Because Treg cells are present in very few numbers and are difficult to expand in vitro, we genetically modified conventional human T-cells to generate Treg cells in vitro by ectopic expression of FoxP3, a transcription factor associated with reprogramming T-cells into a Treg subset. Overexpression of FoxP3 in na&#x000ef;ve human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells recapitulated the hyporesponsiveness and suppressive function of naturally occurring Treg cells. However, FoxP3 was less efficient in reprogramming memory T-cell subset into regulatory cells. In addition, FoxP3-transduced T-cells also became more susceptible to HIV infection. Remarkably, a portion of HIV-positive individuals with a low percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> and higher levels of activated T-cells have greatly reduced levels of FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells, suggesting disruption of the Treg cells during HIV infection. Targeting and disruption of the T-cell regulatory system by HIV may contribute to hyperactivation of conventional T-cells, a characteristic of HIV disease progression. Moreover, the ability to reprogram human T-cells into Treg cells in vitro will greatly aid in decoding their mechanism of suppression, their enhanced susceptibility to HIV infection, and the unique markers expressed by this subset.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Human regulatory T-cells cells (Treg) -- or conventional T cells that have been genetically modified to generate Tregs -- express the HIV-coreceptor CCR5 and are susceptible to HIV infection</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is now compelling evidence that a subset of T-cells with regulatory activity suppresses T-cell activation in both mice and humans (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Sakaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">Sakaguchi et al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Asano1" ref-type="bibr">Asano et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Suri-Payer1" ref-type="bibr">Suri-Payer et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Thornton1" ref-type="bibr">Thornton and Shevach 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Baecher-Allan1" ref-type="bibr">Baecher-Allan et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Dieckmann1" ref-type="bibr">Dieckmann et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Jonuleit1" ref-type="bibr">Jonuleit et al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Jonuleit2" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Levings1" ref-type="bibr">Levings et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Taams1" ref-type="bibr">Taams et al. 2001</xref>).

Upon activation, Treg cells express the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 at a higher level and for a longer period of time than conventional T-cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Read1" ref-type="bibr">Read et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Salomon1" ref-type="bibr">Salomon et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Takahashi2" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al. 2000</xref>). Interestingly, Treg cells have also been shown to express high levels of certain chemokine receptors such as CCR4 and CCR8 (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Iellem1" ref-type="bibr">Iellem et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>The forkhead transcription factor FOXP3 was recently shown to be specifically expressed in mouse Treg cells and is required for their development (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-OaGarra1" ref-type="bibr">O'Garra and Vieira 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Ramsdell1" ref-type="bibr">Ramsdell 2003</xref>).

In addition, expression of FOXP3 in conventional T-cells either in transgenic mice or by retroviral transduction is sufficient to confer a Treg cell phenotype (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Fontenot1" ref-type="bibr">Fontenot et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Hori1" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Khattri1" ref-type="bibr">Khattri et al. 2003</xref>). However, the role of FoxP3 in the development of human Treg cells has not been examined.</p><p>The role of Treg cells in controlling T-cell activation during immune responses to pathogens such as chronic viral infections is currently a subject of great interest. Recently it was shown that Treg cells can regulate virus-specific or memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, thus diminishing the magnitude of the immune response (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Kursar1" ref-type="bibr">Kursar et al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Kursar2" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">Murakami et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Suvas1" ref-type="bibr">Suvas et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Aandahl1" ref-type="bibr">Aandahl et al. 2004</xref>). Because Treg cells express CD4<bold>,</bold> they are also potential targets of HIV in vivo. HIV entry into target cells also requires cellular expression of the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 in conjunction with CD4 (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Boshoff1" ref-type="bibr">Boshoff et al. 1997</xref>). However, the ability of HIV to establish a persistent infection is also critically dependent on activation signals that regulate HIV replication within target T-cells. Quiescent T-cells are resistant to infection unless TCR or cytokine activation signals are provided (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Unutmaz1" ref-type="bibr">Unutmaz 2001</xref>). Indeed, chronic states of T-cell hyperactivation, viral persistence, and T-cell depletion are all hallmarks of HIV infection (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Grossman1" ref-type="bibr">Grossman et al. 2002</xref>). Consequently, this state of chronic immune activation combined with the direct destruction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells by HIV leads to a profound immunodeficiency characterized by progressive deterioration of immune function (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Fauci1" ref-type="bibr">Fauci 1993</xref>). If Treg cells are lost because of HIV infection, this could potentially result in hyperactivation of conventional T-cells due to lack of immunoregulation. In contrast, if Treg cells are activated to expand during certain stages of the infection, this could have a suppressive effect on protective immune responses against the virus. Thus, in both scenarios dysregulation of Treg subset during HIV infection could have a profound impact on anti-HIV immune responses and pathogenesis of the infection.</p><p>We tested the susceptibility of both naturally occurring and in vitro genetically reprogrammed Treg cells to HIV infection. We found that Treg cells isolated from healthy donors express CCR5 and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Ectopic expression of FoxP3 in conventional human T-cells genetically reprogrammed them into a Treg phenotype and enhanced their susceptibility to HIV infection. Remarkably, we also found a profound defect of FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells in HIV-infected patients with low CD4<sup>+</sup> and a high percentage of activated T-cells.</p><p>Our findings have important implications in understanding the role of Treg cells and the chronic activated state of T-cells during HIV infection. Furthermore, reprogramming of T-cells in vitro into Treg cells establishes a novel system to understand the mechanism of T-cell suppression and enhanced susceptibility of this subset to HIV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation and Characterization of Human Treg Cells</title><p>To analyze susceptibility of Treg cells to HIV infection, we first developed a method to isolate these cells from peripheral blood.

To determine whether Treg cells were susceptible to HIV infection, purified Treg cells were first activated through the TCR and were infected with either replication-competent HIV, which uses CCR5 as a coreceptor (R5.HIV), or replication-defective viruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G.HIV) that encode green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker of infection (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Motsinger1" ref-type="bibr">Motsinger et al. 2002</xref>). Treg and memory T-cells challenged with VSV-G.HIV resulted in an equivalent infection rate, while in some experiments R5.HIV resulted in about a 2-fold higher infection rate of the Treg cells as compared to the memory T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). To determine the level of HIV replication in the Treg cells as compared to activated memory T-cells, both subsets were infected with R5.HIV for 2 d and washed to remove input virus. Supernatants were collected from the infected cultures daily and p24 levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HIV replicated in Treg cells as efficiently as in memory T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). To assess whether the virus produced by Treg cells was infectious, supernatants from infected cells were added to Hut78/CCR5 cells, which are highly susceptible to HIV infection, and the titer of infectious virus was determined by GFP expression. Treg cells produced levels of infectious virus similar to those of the memory T subset (data not shown). The viability of infected cultures was also determined at days 3 and 7 to determine if HIV infection killed Treg cells. Indeed, infection with replication-competent HIV was highly cytotoxic to both Treg and memory T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).

Although we could purify several hundred thousand Treg cells from 300 ml of blood as described below, isolation of sufficient numbers of Treg cells is clearly an obstacle to studying their function and susceptibility to HIV infection. Recently, a transcription factor called FOXP3 was shown to program murine T-cells into a Treg subset (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Fontenot1" ref-type="bibr">Fontenot et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Hori1" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Khattri1" ref-type="bibr">Khattri et al. 2003</xref>).

However, a major difficulty in such analysis is that many of the cell surface markers that define Treg cells are also expressed on activated T-cells (CD25, HLA-DR, GITR). Because a portion of HIV-positive individuals contain high levels of activated T-cells, simple cell surface analysis would not be sufficiently reliable to quantify Treg cells in these donors.

Remarkably, overexpression of FoxP3 also greatly enhances the susceptibility of activated T-cells to HIV infection. Although Treg cells constitute a small subset of the total T-cells in humans (less than 1%&#x02013;2%) and thus may not be a significant target population for HIV, they appear to have very potent suppressive activity against activation of T-cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Thornton1" ref-type="bibr">Thornton and Shevach 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Baecher-Allan1" ref-type="bibr">Baecher-Allan et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Curotto1" ref-type="bibr">Curotto de Lafaille and Lafaille 2002</xref>). Here we demonstrate that FoxP3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells are greatly decreased in a portion of HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 and high activated T-cells, suggesting a loss of Treg cells. We therefore propose that infection and disruption of Treg cells during HIV infection could have a major influence on T-cell homeostasis and immune regulation.</p><p>Similar to previous reports, our findings demonstrate that human Treg cells appear to be enriched within the CD25<sup>hi</sup> subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. However, it is not clear if Treg cells are the only population represented in the CD25<sup>hi</sup> subset since they share this phenotype with recently activated T-cells. Indeed, a portion of purified CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells proliferated and their suppressive function was less efficient as compared to FoxP3-expressing cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020198-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Because the purification of Treg cells is rather arbitrary (brightest 1%&#x02013;2% of antibody-stained CD25<sup>+</sup> memory T-cells), it is conceivable that there is sizable contamination of non-Treg cells in these sorted preparations. In addition, the differences seen in the infection susceptibility of Tregs as compared to FoxP3-expressing cells may also be partly due to presence of non-Treg activated T-cells within the purified cells. Identification of the Treg subset in disease conditions with chronic T-cell activation, such as HIV, is even more problematic because a large proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells possibly represent recently activated T-cells. Availability of large numbers of genetically reprogrammed Treg cells should facilitate the identification of novel markers that can reliably detect human Treg cells.</p><p>Our results clearly demonstrate that, similar to the mouse system, ectopic expression of FoxP3 is sufficient to recapitulate all of the characteristics of Treg cells, including lower cytokine secretion, higher expression of CD25 and GITR, and their suppressive functions. This system has allowed us to generate large numbers of Treg cells, which will be invaluable in characterizing their suppressive function as well as mechanisms of enhanced HIV susceptibility. The ability to genetically manipulate primary T-cells to reprogram them into the Treg phenotype also could have profound implications for preventing graft-versus-host disease, a serious clinical condition that can be manifested following hematopoietic cell transplantation (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that na&#x000ef;ve T-cells are more prone to reprogramming into a Treg phenotype than memory T-cells are. This loss in flexibility of reprogramming with a master transcription factor is reminiscent of Th1- and Th2-type T-cell reprogramming with ectopic expression of lineage-specific transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3, respectively (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Sundrud1" ref-type="bibr">Sundrud et al. 2003</xref>). The loss of flexibility in genetic modification of effector/memory T-cells could reflect heritable epigenetic changes at effector gene loci that might otherwise be responsive to FoxP3-mediated transcription. A recent study supports this hypothesis by demonstrating that lineage-committed human memory cells failed to modify their histone acetylation patterns of cytokine genes, unlike na&#x000ef;ve T-cells, to differentiate into Th1- or Th2-type cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Messi1" ref-type="bibr">Messi et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>The cause of progressive depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and the reason for high T-cell activation or turnover during HIV infection remains controversial (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Hazenberg1" ref-type="bibr">Hazenberg et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Grossman1" ref-type="bibr">Grossman et al. 2002</xref>). It is thought that HIV-mediated destruction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells results in decline of this subset and that to maintain homeostasis the immune system attempts to replenish this subset, resulting in a massive turnover of T-cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Perelson1" ref-type="bibr">Perelson et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Mohri1" ref-type="bibr">Mohri et al. 1998</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Mohri2" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). This excessive turnover rate eventually compromises proper function of homeostatic responses. Alternatively, T-cell depletion could result from disrupted thymic and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms by virus-induced generalized T-cell activation and gradual wasting of T-cell supplies, eventually leading to T-cell depletion (<xref rid="pbio-0020198-Hazenberg1" ref-type="bibr">Hazenberg et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020198-Grossman1" ref-type="bibr">Grossman et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, several mechanisms control unwanted activation of T-cells, including thymic deletion of autoreactive T-cells and induction of anergy in the periphery. In addition to these passive mechanisms, recent evidence clearly demonstrates that Treg cells exert an active suppression of T-cell activation. We postulate that the high susceptibility of Treg cells to HIV in vivo, as demonstrated by our in vitro studies, could result in gradual elimination of this subset. This Treg cell decline during HIV infection would in turn reduce active suppression of conventional T-cells and, hence, contribute to hyperactivation of T-cells. Our analyses of peripheral blood T-cells from HIV-infected subjects support this hypothesis that loss of Treg cells during HIV infection contributes to HIV disease progression. Indeed, we found that in a subset of HIV-infected subjects, the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cell subset had greatly reduced FoxP3 expression, suggesting that these cells represent recently activated T-cells rather then Treg cells. The presence of a higher percent of activated T-cells in this FoxP3-low profile supports this conjecture. The HIV-infected subjects with lower levels of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T-cells also contained a lower percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. It is conceivable that the loss of Treg cells may be a correlative factor for disease progression; however, more detailed prospective studies will be required to address this important implication of our findings.</p><p>Our findings show a 2- to 3-fold enhancement of HIV infection in FoxP3-expressing T-cells. While freshly purified Treg and memory T-cells are similar in their susceptibility to HIV infection, activated effector T-cells become gradually more resistant to infection (unpublished results). Indeed, preactivated T-cells require reactivation to render them susceptible to infection after about 1&#x02013;2 weeks in culture (unpublished results). We do not yet know the mechanisms by which FoxP3 renders activated T-cells more susceptible to infection; however, two possibilities can be considered: (1) FoxP3 may be overcoming innate resistance factor(s) that accumulate in activated T-cells that block HIV infection, or (2) FoxP3 expression may be inducing critical host factors that are required for efficient completion of the HIV life cycle in primary T-cells. It is important to note that since FoxP3 expression enhances VSV-G.HIV single-round infections, it likely affects an early, postentry step in viral replication. Determining the mechanisms by which FoxP3 enhances HIV infection could reveal host factors involved in this process.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that both naturally occurring and genetically reprogrammed Treg cells are susceptible to HIV infection and that ectopic FoxP3 expression greatly increases the susceptibility of T-cells to HIV infection. Our finding that FoxP3-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T-cells are greatly reduced in HIV patients with low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell percentages and increased T-cell activation suggests that loss of Treg cells may contribute to HIV disease progression. Further prospective studies will be required to unravel the role of this important subset in HIV infection. The ability to genetically reprogram conventional human T-cells to generate Treg cells will also lead the way to identifying unique markers expressed on this population in order to further investigate their status in HIV-infected individuals. Moreover, understanding how FoxP3 enhances HIV infection and programs T-cells into the Treg subset could help in the identification of novel host factors that mediate HIV infection in primary T-cells and decoding the molecular mechanisms by which Treg cells mediate their suppressive function.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Study subjects and statistical analysis</title><p>Healthy subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 11) were adults who were HIV-negative and with no history of chronic viral infections such as Hepatitis B or C.
