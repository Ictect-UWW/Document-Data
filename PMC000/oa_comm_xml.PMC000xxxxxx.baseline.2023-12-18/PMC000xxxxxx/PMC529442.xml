Up to now, six methyl-DNA binding proteins could be identified in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. MeCP2, MBD2 and MBD3 can be found in large chromatin complexes containing histone deacetylase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] whereas MBD4 is involved in DNA mismatch-repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. MBD1 has been shown to repress transcription in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and recruits the histone H3-K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 to the chromatin assembly factor CAF-1 during S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. MBD2, which can bind methylated DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], is a transcriptional repressor recruiting a <underline>Nu</underline>cleosome <underline>R</underline>emodelling and <underline>D</underline>eacetylase complex (NuRD) to methylated CpG dinucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], whereas mammalian MBD3, which is not able to bind methylated DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] is an integral component of NuRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Kaiso, a transcriptional repressor protein, can bind directly to CpG methylated DNA even though it lacks a conserved methyl-DNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Kaiso is a component of a subpopulation of MeCP1 complexes that lack MBD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>gene <italic>MBD2/3 </italic>encodes a protein, which shares high homology to mammalian MBD2 and MBD3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Due to differential splicing, <italic>Drosophila MBD2/3 </italic>is expressed in two isoforms, the smaller one is lacking part of the putative methyl-DNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The large isoform is expressed during early development, whereas the small isoform can only be detected during late embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In insect cells expressing only the small MBD2/3 isoform, this protein was found to be associated with components of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NuRD complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, this protein could repress transcription effectively in transfected <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The NuRD complexes of vertebrates are a heterogeneous group of complexes containing both histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodelling activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. NuRD complexes comprise at least seven proteins. The ATP- dependent nucleosome-remodelling activity is mediated by MI-2, which contains a SWI2/SNF2-type helicase/ATPase domain, two chromodomains and two PHD fingers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The related MTA1, MTA2 and MTA3 proteins have been found in various complex preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. MTA1 was originally identified as being overexpressed in metastatic carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and the two histone binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 form the histone deacetylase core of NuRD complexes. Finally, as mentioned above, mammalian MBD3 is an integral component of at least some NuRD complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Strikingly, the <italic>Drosophila </italic>genome contains clear homologues for all verterbrate NuRD proteins. Recombinant <italic>Drosophila </italic>MI-2 was shown to have ATPase and nucleosome mobilization properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila </italic>the HDAC gene <italic>Rpd3 </italic>is important for segmentation of the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila </italic>p55, a WD-40 protein, is homologous to the histone deacetylase-associated proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Finally, <italic>Drosophila </italic>MTA-like displays extensive homology to the vertebrate MTA proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The strong conservation between vertebrate NuRD complexes and the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NuRD complex implies a conserved function during the animal development. In previous studies cell lines were analysed that express only the small isoform of MBD2/3, lacking part of the putative methyl-DNA binding domain and a <italic>Drosophila </italic>specific domain. In order to analyse isoform-specific differences of MBD2/3 and their ability to bind NuRD proteins, we now extend our analysis to both isoforms in <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>MBD2/3 is associated with <italic>Drosophila </italic>NuRD proteins</title><p>An association of <italic>Drosophila </italic>MBD2/3 with the NuRD complex has been suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, these experiments were done in vitro or with protein extracts from tissue culture cells that express only the small isoform of MBD2/3. In addition, only a limited number of NuRD proteins were analysed. To confirm the association between MBD2/3 and NuRD in <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos we size-fractionated nuclear protein extracts from 2&#x02013;4 h or 0&#x02013;12 h wild type embryos, respectively, by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography. Proteins from individual fractions were then separated by standard SDS-PAGE and analysed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against known homologous subunits of the NuRD complex. MI-2 and MTA-like, which are homologues of subunits that are specific for vertebrate NuRD complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] cofractionated with an apparent molecular weight of 1 MDa when extracts derived from early embryos (2&#x02013;4 h) were applied (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, fractions 19 to 21). When extracts of late embryos (0&#x02013;12 h) were analysed, MI-2 and MTA-like were detected in fractions 15 to 19, which correspond to an apparent molecular weight of approx. 2 MDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This result indicates that the formation of NuRD is developmentally regulated during embryogenesis. Additionally, we found a precise cofractionation of the large isoform of MBD2/3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, MBD2/3li) with MI-2 and MTA-like in both cases. The small MBD2/3 isoform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, MBD2/3si) present in extracts derived from late embryos likewise cofractionated with MI-2 and MTA-like. This suggests a close association of both MBD2/3 isoforms with the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NuRD complex. The RPD3 and p55 proteins also cofractionated with MBD2/3 isoforms, but they were also found in fractions of lower molecular weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This is in agreement with the fact that both RPD3 and p55 are also components of other chromatin related complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cofractionation of <italic>Drosophila </italic>NuRD homologues in embryonic protein extracts </bold>Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from (A) 2&#x02013;4 h and (B) 0&#x02013;12 h old embryos, respectively and size-fractionated by FPLC using a Superose 6 column. Proteins from selected fractions were then separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and analysed by Western blotting. (A) During early embryogenesis the long isoform of MBD2/3 (MBD2/3li) cofractionated with MI-2 and MTA-like in fractions 19 to 21 (indicated in red), which correspond to a molecular weight of approx. 1 MDa.

In order to eliminate unspecific interactions with NuRD proteins, we established highly stringent assay conditions. This was achieved by assessing the interactions between radioactively labeled SV40 large T antigen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, large T) and a number of control GST fusion proteins. When we used an incubation and washing buffer with high salt and detergent concentrations, significant amounts of SV40 large T were precipitated by p53 only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), which is known to be a strong interactor of the large T antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Residual binding detected with some of the other proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) was considered background.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Interactions between MBD2/3 and NuRD homologues in a GST-pulldown assay </bold>(A) Analysis of interactions between radioactively labelled SV40 large T antigen (large T) and a number of control GST fusion proteins under stringent buffer conditions.

(B) GST-MBD2/3 fusion proteins for long and small isoforms (MBD2/3li, MBD2/3si, respectively) efficiently precipitated radioactively labelled MBD2/3 long isoform and p55 (solid arrowhead). Similarly, MI-2 protein could be precipitated by the small GST-MBD2/3 isoform (solid arrowhead). No interaction could be observed between long MBD2/3 or small MBD2/3 isoforms and MTA-like or RPD3 (open arrowheads). (C) A MBD2/3-specific antibody immunoprecipitates p55, but not GAGA factor from embryonic nuclear extracts. No proteins were detectable in control immunoprecipitations with a myc-specific antibody. (D) Size-fractionation of baculovirus-expressed MBD2/3 long isoform and RPD3. Baculovirus-expressed MBD2/3li elutes in fractions that significantly exceed the calculated molecular weight of the protein (36 kDa), thus indicating that MBD2/3li efficiently multimerizes in solution. This effect appeared to be specific for MBD2/3 and was not observed with baculovirus-expressed RPD3 protein (58kDa). The size of marker proteins is shown left and on top, IN indicates input protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-5-20-2"/></fig><p>We then performed the MBD2/3-NuRD interaction assay using these conditions and observed strong interactions only between the long and small MBD2/3 isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, MBD2/3li and MBD2/3si, respectively) and p55. To confirm the association between MBD2/3 and p55 in <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos we immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts with MBD2/3-specific antibodies and with myc-specific control antibodies. Precipitates were analysed by Western blot for the presence of p55 and GAGA factor. This revealed a specific association of MBD2/3 with the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NuRD homologue p55, but not with the unrelated GAGA factor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>A weaker interaction could also be detected between the small MBD2/3 isoform and MI-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Neither RPD3 nor MTA-like binding exceeded the background level defined by our pilot experiment with SV40 large T protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Our results thus identified p55 and MI-2 as the direct interaction partners of MBD2/3 in the NuRD complex. In addition, our results from the GST-pulldown assay indicate that <italic>Drosophila </italic>MBD2/3 forms dimers or multimers, similar to mammalian MBD2 and MBD3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To discriminate between the latter two possibilities we expressed a recombinant long MBD2/3 isoform and RPD3 in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Extracts from infected cells were subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration and fractions were analysed by Western blot. The 58 kDa RPD3 protein eluted in fractions corresponding to molecular weights ranging from 66 kDa to 158 kDa, which suggested that RPD3 exists as monomers or dimers in solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In contrast, the 36 kDa MBD2/3 isoform showed a strikingly different elution profile (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The long MBD2/3 isoform eluted in a broad peak ranging from more than 158 kDa up to high molecular weight fractions (&#x0003e;400 kDa). No MBD2/3 was detected in fractions corresponding to the expected size of MBD2/3 monomers or dimers. This result is consistent with our earlier observation that MBD2/3 forms distinct aggregates in embryonic nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and suggests that the protein efficiently oligomerises to form high-molecular weight complexes in solution.</p><p>To confirm these interactions in an independent set of experiments we also analysed the association between MBD2/3 isoforms and the NuRD proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In agreement with our previous results, growth on highly selective (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, panel H) plates was only observed upon co-expression of the MBD2/3 small isoform and either MI-2, MBD2/3 long isoform or p55, and upon co-expression of both MBD2/3 isoforms. These interactions were confirmed by X-Gal staining of filter-lifted yeast colonies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, panel X). In these assays the two MBD2/3 isoforms differed only with regard to MI-2 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, differential binding could be eliminated by a slight reduction in the stringency of the assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, panel M), which suggested that both isoforms of MBD2/3 are capable of interacting with MI-2. Consistent with our GST-pulldown assays no interaction could be detected between the MBD2/3 long isoform and RPD3 or MTA-like (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Interactions between MBD2/3 and NuRD homologues in a yeast two-hybrid assay </bold>(A) An MBD2/3 long isoform bait efficiently transactivated reporter gene transcription in yeast expressing p55 or MBD2/3 small isoform prey constructs, respectively. A weaker transactivation could be seen upon expression of a MI-2 prey construct (panel M). An MBD2/3 small isoform bait transactivated reporter gene transcription co-expressing a MI-2 prey also under high-stringent conditions (panel H). No transactivation could be observed with MTA-like or RPD3 preys. N shows growth on non-selective plates, M on medium-stringency plates and H on high-stringency plates.

(B) The C-terminal region of MBD2/3 interacts with p55. The full-length p55 construct was used as a bait and various deletion mutants of MBD2/3 were used as preys. This identified the region between amino acids 178 and 305 of the MBD2/3 long isoform as the p55 interaction domain. (C) Deletion of the coiled-coil domain abolishes interactions between MBD2/3 small isoform and MI-2 under high stringent conditions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-5-20-3"/></fig><p>Next we sought to delineate the domains that mediate the association between the MBD2/3 isoforms and their interacting proteins. To this end, we generated several MBD2/3 deletion mutants and tested their interaction with other proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In a first series of experiments we tested the MBD2/3 mutants for their ability to interact with p55. This identified the region between residues 178 and 305 of the MBD2/3 long isoform as the p55 interaction domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We also delineated the domain that mediates the interaction with MI-2. Our experiments revealed a strongly reduced interaction between a MBD2/3 small isoform derivative lacking the coiled-coil domain and MI-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). It has been shown previously that vertebrate MBD2 and MBD3 form homo- and heterodimers via their N-terminal MBD domain and their C-terminal coiled-coil like sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our findings might reflect a direct interaction between the coiled-coil domain and MI-2 or a requirement for efficient MBD2/3 multimerization for MI-2 interaction. In conclusion, our results identify distinct regions in the MBD2/3 protein that mediate protein-protein interactions with other NuRD proteins.</p><p>In order to analyse the architecture of the NuRD complex, we performed a detailed yeast two-hybrid analysis including additional bait and prey constructs for NuRD proteins. Bait constructs for MI-2, RPD3, p55 and both MBD2/3 isoforms and prey constructs for MTA-like, RPD3, p55, and both MBD2/3 isoforms were co-transformed in all possible combinations and transformation was confirmed by growth on non-selective plates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Colonies were then replicated onto highly selective plates that allow growth only upon interaction between the two expressed proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Finally, we performed a filter lift assay followed by X-Gal staining to confirm the interactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In addition to the results presented above, we found strong interactions between p55 and all NuRD proteins. We also observed a homotypic interaction for p55 but no homotypic interaction for RPD3. To confirm the specificity of the interactions, we tested most of the constructs reciprocally by changing the bait and prey vectors for expression of NuRD proteins and MBD2/3 isoforms. This data allows the establishment of a more detailed model of the NuRD complex. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> summarizes the data from all experiments. p55 interacted with MI-2, MTA-like, RPD3, and both MBD2/3 isoforms.

For example, we have shown that p55 appears to be the primary interaction partner of MBD2/3. We also observed a strong interaction between the small isoform MBD2/3 and MI-2, but not between MBD2/3 small isoform and MTA-like or RPD3. Additionally, we found interactions between p55 and all NuRD proteins, as well as a p55 homotypic interaction. The last finding is consistent with the fact that in the vertebrate NuRD complex the two p55 homologues RbAp46 and RbAp48 were identified as integral components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We note that the vertebrate NuRD complex also contains the two RPD3 homologues HDAC1 and HDAC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; unexpectedly, we were not able to detect any homotypic interaction of RPD3 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. One explanation could be that the dose of the two co-expressed RPD3 bait and prey proteins could interfere with the reporter gene activity due to their inherent histone deacetylation activity. However, the gel filtration assay revealed that the 58 kDa RPD3 protein eluted in fractions corresponding to molecular weights ranging from 66 kDa to 158 kDa, which suggested that RPD3 can interact homotypically (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that more complex interactions are involved in the assembly of the NuRD complex but they might not have been detectable under the stringent conditions of our assays. The interaction between MBD2/3 and MI-2 detected in our assays could also contribute to the specific association between MBD2/3 and the NuRD complex.</p><p>The interaction between MBD2/3 and p55 could promote the assembly of specialized chromatin structures in the fly. p55 is a WD-40 repeat protein that is involved in many aspects of chromatin organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. For example, p55 has been shown to be a component of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>CAF-1 complex that promotes nucleosome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, p55 is also contained in the NURF chromatin remodelling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and in the E(Z) complex that regulates homeotic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A mutant <italic>Drosophila </italic>allele for <italic>p55 </italic>is not available, but results obtained from <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>mutants with decreased levels of a p55 homologue indicate that the protein plays an important role in stabilizing epigenetic chromatin structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The goal of this study was to identify the interacting partners of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>methyl-DNA binding protein MBD2/3 within the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NuRD complex. We identified p55 and MI-2 as the primary interacting partners. We also found homo- and heterotypic interactions of the MBD2/3 isoforms, similar to vertebrate MBD2 and MBD3. Additionally, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that p55 is able to specifically interact with all other NuRD proteins and can form homotypic interactions. Our data provides for the first time information about the architecture of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NuRD complex. This allows us to develop a structural model of the NuRD complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs</title><p>Constructs for the yeast two-hybrid assay were generated by PCR amplification from cDNA clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] using specific primers (Tab. 1) with an attached restriction endonuclease target site for cloning.
