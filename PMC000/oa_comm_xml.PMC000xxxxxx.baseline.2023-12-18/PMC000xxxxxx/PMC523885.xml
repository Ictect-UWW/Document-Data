</related-article><abstract><title>ABSTRACT</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema are a frequent result of long-term smoking, but the exact mechanisms, specifically which types of cells are associated with the lung destruction, are unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We studied different subsets of lymphocytes taken from portions of human lungs removed surgically to find out which lymphocytes were the most frequent, which cell-surface markers these lymphocytes expressed, and whether the lymphocytes secreted any specific factors that could be associated with disease. We found that loss of lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema was associated with a high percentage of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes that expressed chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 (both markers of T helper 1 cells), but not CCR3 or CCR4 (markers of T helper 2 cells). Lung lymphocytes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema secrete more interferon gamma&#x02014;often associated with T helper 1 cells&#x02014;and interferon-inducible protein 10 and monokine induced by interferon, both of which bind to CXCR3 and are involved in attracting T helper 1 cells. In response to interferon-inducible protein 10 and monokine induced by interferon, but not interferon gamma, lung macrophages secreted macrophage metalloelastase (matrix metalloproteinase-12), a potent elastin-degrading enzyme that causes tissue destruction and which has been linked to emphysema.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data suggest that Th1 lymphoctytes in the lungs of people with smoking-related damage drive progression of emphysema through CXCR3 ligands, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monokine induced by interferon.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The underlying changes that cause smoking-related damage are unclear.

A role for T helper cells in the pathogenesis of obstructive lung disease has been established with asthma, where T helper 2 (Th2) cells are strongly linked to both human and experimental disease [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A potential role for T cells in COPD has also been suggested in several recent studies that show CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are increased in the lungs of people who smoke [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. T cells cause tissue injury through their secreted products such as cytokines; in mice, overexpression of interleukin (IL)-13, a T cell cytokine that is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental asthma, resulted in increased production of proteases and enlargement of airspaces reminiscent of emphysema [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further, airway limitation, another characteristic of human asthma, is clinically linked to an accelerated rate of loss of lung function in smoker individuals [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It has been suggested, therefore, that asthma and COPD may involve the same type of recruited inflammatory cells, differing only in their location within the lung [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Chemokines, their receptors, and cell adhesion molecules regulate migration of immune cells into inflamed tissue [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. T helper 1 (Th1) cells have been shown to secrete interleukin 2 and interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;), and express a distinct repertoire of chemokine receptors such as CCR5 and CXCR3 [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, Th2 cells that are biased to produce IL-4 and IL-5 express mainly CCR4 and CCR3 [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Immunofluorescent analysis of airway mucosal biopsies in patients with asthma showed that most T cells co-express IL-4 and CCR4, but, in contrast, T cells in airways of patients with COPD and pulmonary sarcoidosis produce IFN-&#x003b3; and express high levels of CXCR3, while lacking CCR4 expression [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition to T cells, a wide variety of other inflammatory cells have been shown to express distinct chemokine receptors that are critical for their homing, suggesting a universal mechanism for regulating immune responses. Interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monokine induced by interferon gamma (MIG), and interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC) are three known ligands for CXCR3 produced by normal and injured epithelial cells and T cells that are required for homing of Th1 cells [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition to regulation of chemotaxis and homing, other functions have been ascribed to chemokines, including modulation of T cell fate by direct effects on differentiating T cells, and regulation of proteolysis in blood monocytes [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In this study we determined the dominant T helper phenotype in lung samples from ex-smoker individuals with moderate to severe COPD and emphysema and control individuals with no evidence of smoking-related lung disease. Analysis of chemokine receptor expression on isolated peripheral lung lymphocytes from ex-smokers with COPD/emphysema indicated that both CD4 and CD8 T helper cells are strongly polarized to the Th1 phenotype compared to T cells isolated from lung tissue of normal individuals or individuals with non-smoking-related obstructive lung disease. The same cells spontaneously secreted more IFN-&#x003b3; and CXCR3 receptor ligands MIG and IP-10 in the COPD and emphysema group than in the group without emphysema. Further, IP-10 and MIG, but not IFN-&#x003b3;, upregulated macrophage metalloelastase (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-12) from isolated lung macrophages. Together, our findings reveal the strong association between COPD/emphysema- and Th1-driven adaptive immunity, suggesting a link to lung destruction mediated by IFN-&#x003b3;, MIG, and IP-10.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-eight non-atopic ex-smoker individuals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0010008-t001">Table 1</xref>) undergoing medically necessary lung resection were serially entered into the study: ten individuals with no COPD and no evidence of emphysema (control group) and eighteen individuals (diseased group) with moderate to severe COPD and evidence of emphysema as determined by pulmonary function tests, high-resolution computed tomography (CT), or conventional CT scan.

Therefore, to be relevant to the pathogenesis of airway obstruction, type 1 inflammation must be shown to promote lung elastolysis. Because loss of elastin is regulated by proteinases [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we next determined if expression of MMPs, in particular the elastases MMP9 and MMP12, was regulated by IP-10, MIG, and IFN-&#x003b3;, the principal cytokines detected in emphysematous lung.

Three principal findings emerge from our study. First, rather than being functionally diverse, as suggested by the heterogeneous nature of humans, lung T cells of ex-smoker individuals with emphysema are relatively homogeneous and characterized by a marked Th1 bias. Second, the principal Th1 chemokines, MIG and IP-10, are linked to a pro-elastolytic lung environment because these cytokines upregulate the elastase MMP12, which is associated with emphysema. Finally, we found no significant expression of Th2 chemokine receptors, such as CCR3 and CCR4, or IL-4 production in lung lymphocytes. Together, our findings demonstrate the role of the adaptive immune response in COPD and suggest a primary role for Th1 cells in controlling the main smoking-related physiologic and structural changes of the lung.</p><p>Upregulation of CCR5 and CXCR3 on T cells and accumulation of these cells in the lung periphery suggest that aberrant, unremitting pulmonary recruitment of these activated T cells is unique to people with smoking-related lung disease, despite cessation of exposure to the inciting agent, tobacco smoke. We showed that ex-smoker individuals without obstructive lung disease or emphysema have comparatively little Th1-biased inflammation in their lungs; thus, our findings reflect the inflammatory changes that are unique to the COPD microenvironment. Additionally, lung lymphocytes isolated from four lifelong non-smoker individuals with severe obstructive lung disease due to cystic fibrosis or bronchiolitis obliterans did not show a Th1 inflammatory bias of the lung (S. Grumelli, F. Kheradmand, D. B. Corry, unpublished data). This information confirmed our finding that the predominant Th1 bias in COPD/emphysema reflects the microenvironment unique to the lungs of ex-smoker individuals. The prevalence of asthma among people who smoke is currently not known, but in order to study COPD/emphysema in a population without other confounding variables, people who might have had asthma were excluded, and thus our findings are restricted to non-asthmatic individuals with emphysema.</p><p>Our use of T cell chemokine receptor expression analysis to determine recruitment of lung T cells is not without precedent. Analysis by immunohistochemistry of airway mucosa of people with atopic asthma after antigen challenge revealed that large numbers of CCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CCR8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells express IL-4, and CCR4 expression was prominent in people with severe atopic dermatitis, which decreased upon abatement of disease activity [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Immunostaining of T cells in synovial fluid from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis showed that virtually all of the T cells associated with inflamed joints expressed CXCR3 and CCR5, representing significant enrichment compared to blood T cells from the same participants. Furthermore, previous studies of smoker individuals with COPD and normal lung function showed the presence of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/CXCR3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the airway epithelium and submucosa [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We extend these findings by showing CXCR3 expression on lung macrophages and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in emphysema patients and the functional interplay between Th1-related chemokines and elastolytic MMPs.</p><p>In addition to detailing surface chemokine receptor expression, we have functionally confirmed the marked Th1 bias of peripheral lung T cells, demonstrating that either at rest or following stimulation, these cells secrete IFN-&#x003b3; and not IL-4. Our findings therefore confirm the utility of chemokine receptor expression patterns in the initial assessment of T cell effector phenotype.</p><p>Destruction of lung parenchyma in emphysema is thought to occur through excessive proteolysis mediated by the elastin-degrading enzymes MMP2, MMP9, and MMP12 from the MMP family, and by neutrophil elastase from the serine proteinase family [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Cytokines and chemokines are substrates for MMPs, but they also regulate expression of MMPs under pathological conditions [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We have shown here that IP-10 and MIG, two chemokines that are secreted from lung lymphocytes of participants with emphysema, upregulate specifically MMP12 and thus favor a proteolytic microenvironment that facilitates lung destruction. Strengthening the association between lung macrophages and IP-10/MIG-dependent MMP12 secretion is the fact that we have demonstrated that in humans macrophages, like T cells, express CXCR3 and that this receptor is required for MMP12 secretion in response to IP-10/MIG stimulation. In addition to defining the predominant immune phenotype of emphysematous lung, these additional findings implicate the principal cell (macrophage), MMP (MMP12), and effector cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;, IP-10, and MIG) as likely underlying smoking-induced lung destruction. We have further shown that these enzymes may be regulated by proximal immune events driven by Th1 cells or Th1-associated cytokines. A question of major importance for future study is, therefore, the nature of the antigens and adjuvant factors that ultimately drive this inflammatory response.</p><p>Although this was an entirely human study, our findings show remarkable parallels with studies performed in mice. MMP12 deficiency has been shown to protect mice against emphysema after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke, implying that MMP12 may be the key proteinase in the development of emphysema in this species [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Studies from both humans and mice therefore firmly suggest the importance of MMP12 in the pathogenesis of emphysema. Interestingly, in addition to solubilizing elastin, MMP12 is the MMP most efficient at degrading &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin, the primary physiological inhibitor of human leukocyte elastase [<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0010008-b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, chemokine-induced upregulation of MMP12 may orchestrate lung matrix degradation both directly and indirectly through inactivation of &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin. The therapy of COPD and emphysema is currently limited to pharmacologic bronchodilation to relieve dyspnea, antibiotics for intercurrent respiratory tract infection, and vaccination against prominent respiratory pathogens. Aside from efforts to prevent smoking or encourage cessation, there exist no measures that prevent development of emphysema or treat the specific causes of airway obstruction. By providing insight into the immunopathogenesis of COPD, our findings provide genuine hope that future therapies capable of preventing or halting smoking-related lung disease may be possible.</p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><caption><title>Patient Summary</title></caption><sec id="sb1a"><title/><sec id="sb1a1"><title>Background</title><p>Many people develop long-term lung problems after smoking, including a condition called emphysema. At the very end of the airways are tiny air sacs. In healthy people, the air sacs stretch and relax easily on breathing in and out. But in people with emphysema, the air sacs fill up with air but can't empty out properly, so air gets trapped, making breathing difficult. While the symptoms of emphysema can be treated, there are no treatments that can reverse the damage to the lung.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a2"><title>What Did the Researchers Find?</title><p>The researchers studied two groups of patients, all ex-smokers who had been admitted to a hospital to have part of their lung removed&#x02014;some because of cancer, some for other reasons. The researchers studied the lung samples and looked to see exactly what type of immune cells the patients with emphysema had in their lungs and found that most of the immune cells were of one particular type. The researchers also showed that the immune cells could tell other lung cells to produce chemicals that can damage the lung.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a3"><title>What Does This Mean for Patients?</title><p>Lung damage in emphysema may not be caused directly by toxins in cigarette smoke. Instead, if you have emphysema, your body may react to the toxins and produce a special kind of immune cell that is key in causing the lung damage. So perhaps if doctors can find a way to change how this cell behaves, it might be possible to reduce or limit the lung damage. Obviously, not smoking, or stopping smoking, is the best way to prevent COPD or emphysema.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a4"><title>What Are the Problems with the Study?</title><p>The study is quite small, which means that the results may not be completely accurate; in particular, the study did not include detailed information from patients who had never smoked. So it is too soon to say for sure whether these special immune cells really are the link between smoking and lung damage in emphysema. Researchers will need to study many more patients with emphysema as well as people who have never smoked.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a5"><title>Where Can I Find More Information?</title><p>Two places to start are the patient Web pages of the following professional organizations.</p><p>American Association for Respiratory Care: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yourlunghealth.org/diseases_conditions/copd/">http://www.yourlunghealth.org/diseases_conditions/copd/</ext-link>
