These conditions such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and hyperglycemia might induce hypertension through various mechanisms. Metabolic syndrome and the resulting NIDDM represent a major clinical challenge because implementation of treatment strategies is difficult. Vascular abnormalities probably contribute to the etiology of many diabetic complications including nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiomyopathy. It has been shown that in Streptozotocin induced diabetic animals there is an increase in maximal responses to 5-Hydroxytryptamine and Angiotensin II. The purpose of this study was to evaluate High fat diet fed rats for the development of hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia and to assess their vascular responses to 5-Hydroxytryptamine and Angiotensin II.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Male Sprague Dawley rats were used for this study and were divided into two equal groups. One of the groups was fed with normal pellet diet and they served as the control group, whereas the other group was on a high fat diet for 4 weeks. Body weight, plasma triglycerides, plasma cholesterol, and plasma glucose were measured every week. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed after 4 weeks of feeding. At the end of fourth week of high fat diet feeding, thoracic aortae were removed, and cut into helical strips for vascular reactivity studies. Dose-response curves of 5-Hydroxytryptamine and Angiotensin II were obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference in pD<sub>2</sub>, with 5-Hydroxytryptamine and Angiotensin II in both groups but E<sub>max </sub>was increased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that hypertension in high fat diet rats is associated with increased in vitro vascular reactivity to 5-HT and Ang II.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Syndrome X comprises a plethora of conditions such as obesity, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It places stress on multiple organ systems and plays a significant role in the development of other related cardiovascular disorders. Western style diet, which contains high levels of fat, is also considered to be one of the main factors in the development of obesity and insulin resistance. The most common reason for the development of hyperinsulinemia (decreased hepatic insulin clearance and/or increased insulin secretion) from insulin resistance is obesity. Excess fat deposits in the white adipose tissue affects insulin mediated glucose metabolism in non adipose tissues, causes disordered insulin response and increases lipid deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, pathophysiologies of vascular complications in syndrome X have not been fully understood. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is shown to be related to pathogenesis of vasculopathy in diabetes. Various studies in humans and rabbits have reported increased plasma 5-HT levels and enhanced contraction to 5-HT in diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Another vasopressor peptide, Angiotensin II (Ang II) is involved in cardiovascular complications of diabetes mellitus. Many have reported that the vascular Renin angiotensin system is one of the key systems in the etiology of vascular alterations in early stages of diabetes. It is already established that 5-HT and Ang II responses are altered in the aortic rings of streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and high fructose diet fed rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, very little information is available in the literature regarding the vascular contractile responses to vasopressor agents such as 5-HT and Ang II in HFD fed rats.</p><p>The aim of this study was to elucidate the contractile responses to 5-HT and Ang II in HFD fed rat thoracic aorta which will provide an avenue for further exploratory studies. We have selected HFD fed rat model for our study because it is a useful model of the putative effects of excess fat intake in humans and it represents the major sub type of diabetes mellitus, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Biochemical measurements</title><p>HFD fed rats showed significant increase in body weight as compared to NPD fed rats (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In addition, the rats fed HFD showed significant elevation in the basal plasma glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol and insulin levels at the end of four weeks of dietary manipulation as compared to NPD fed control groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The HFD fed rats exhibited significant elevation in basal fasting glucose and showed significant impairment in glucose tolerance to exogenously administered glucose (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Obese people have increased incidence of NIDDM with high percentage of mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Western style diet, which is abundant with calorically dense and saturated fatty foods, is considered to be the main factor in the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Our studies have shown that HFD causes increase in bodyweight when compared to NPD after four weeks of dietary manipulation in rats.</p><p>Hyperglycemia is observed in insulin resistance where glucose utilization is reduced. We saw significant elevations in blood glucose levels. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests confirm severe glucose intolerance. Oversupply of dietary lipids causes insulin resistance in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Randle glucose fatty acid cycle suggested that the body prefers excess lipid stores to glucose for metabolic oxidation in insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our HFD model also exhibited high plasma triglyceride levels. Hence studies on our experimental model in compliance with Randle et al findings suggested that HFD feeding causes insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia is a prominent feature of metabolic syndrome. The most common reason for the development of hyperinsulinemia in insulin resistance is obesity. It stands as one of the major cardiovascular risk factors in patients with obesity. The present study on HFD rats demonstrated higher plasma insulin levels than control values. This marked hyperinsulinemia could be due to a combination of increased &#x003b2;-cell mass and decreased insulin clearance, as well as failure of insulin to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Elevated cholesterol is also observed in insulin resistant individuals. For this reason we measured plasma cholesterol levels which were found to be more than normal values. Previous studies have reported a down regulation of LDL receptors and associated decrease in LDL clearance, increased total cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>According to National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (Third report) easily measured clinical findings for syndrome X includes increased abdominal circumference, elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and elevated fasting blood glucose and/or elevated blood pressure. Three of these five are required for diagnosis. Our study demonstrated three of the clinical parameters indicating conditions of syndrome X in HFD fed rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Insulin resistance along with other conditions of syndrome X might induce hypertension by a host of mechanisms involving insulin itself, increased sodium reabsorption and/or enhanced intra cellular concentration of free calcium in vascular smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although the etiology of vascular disorders in metabolic syndrome has not completely been revealed, it is suggested that alterations in the reactivity of blood vessels to neurotransmitters and circulating hormones are responsible for the functional abnormalities of blood vessels.</p><p>In order to elaborate the pathways that connect syndrome X to hypertension we have studied the contractile responses to 5-HT and Ang II in both HFD and NPD fed rat thoracic aortae. Previously we have demonstrated increased contractile responses with synthetic alpha adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, in HFD fed rat thoracic aorta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This enabled us to explore the role of these endogenous mediators in the same animal model.</p><p>The present vascular studies demonstrated that the magnitude of responses to 5-HT and Ang II was significantly enhanced in HFD fed animals without change in pD<sub>2 </sub>value. Endothelial denudation obviates any related mechanisms such as impairment of NO release, increased destruction of EDRF and substrate availability for the production of EDRF. Hence, the probable reasons for these enhanced 5-HT and Ang II responses may be due to receptor mediated or non-receptor mediated pathways.</p><p>The role of non-receptor mediated contraction can be ruled out for there was no change in contractile response to KCl. Vascular studies have also shown functional evidence that hypertension developed in HFD fed rats may be associated with enhanced vasoreactivity to various vasoconstrictor agents. Further the enhanced responses to 5-HT in HFD fed rats could be due to increased PKC as previously reported with STZ and alloxan (ALL) induced diabetic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Increased contractions to 5-HT can also be related to 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>upregulation as observed in spontaneously hypertensive rats or due to serotonin acting through alpha adrenoceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Increased Ang II responses in HFD fed rats are may be due to upregulation of Ang II receptors as observed in hyperinsulinemia or via amplified secondary messenger systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A proposed scheme of events is given in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Proposed events underlying syndrome X in HFD rats. HFD leads to condition, in rats, similar to syndrome X. This includes obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia which all are interrelated. These events are the initial steps in the cascade towards hypertension. This could be mediated via increased contractile responses to various endogenous mediators such as 5-HT and Ang II.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-511X-3-19-4"/></fig><p>In summary, the present study has shown that HFD feeding in rats produces conditions similar to syndrome X. Increased vasocontractile responses observed in the model are not only mediated via alpha adrenoceptors but also due to 5-HT and Ang II (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>More robust studies on the secondary messenger systems of 5-HT and Ang II will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying increased vascular contractility in insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue Preparation</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (central animal facility, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), India), 160&#x02013;200 g, were kept in controlled environmental conditions with room temperature 22 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C, humidity 55 &#x000b1; 5% and 12-h light/dark cycles.
