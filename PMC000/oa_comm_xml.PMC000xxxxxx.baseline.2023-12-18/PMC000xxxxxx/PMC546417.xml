Life expectancy was often limited by uncontrolled epidemics. After the second World War, with medical research achievements in terms of vaccination, antibiotics and improvement of life conditions, non communicable diseases(NCDs) started causing major problems in industrialized countries. Heart diseases, cancer, diabetes, chronic pulmonary and mental diseases became a real burden for health systems in developed countries. For a while, these diseases were associated with economic development and so called diseases of the rich. Then, by the dawn of the third millennium, NCDs appeared sweeping the entire globe, with an increasing trend in developing countries (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) where, the transition imposes more constraints to deal with the double burden of infective and non-infective diseases in a poor environment characterized by ill-health systems. In 1990 the leading causes of disease burden were pneumonia, diarrhoeal diseases and perinatal conditions. By 2020, it is predicted that NCDs will account for 80 percent of the global burden of disease, causing seven out of every 10 deaths in developing countries, compared with less than half today[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Evolution of NCDs in developing countries (in million) [1,8,9]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">Non-Communicable Diseases</td><td align="left">Communicable Diseases<break/>+ Maternal + Perinatal<break/>+ Nutritional</td><td align="center">Injuries</td><td align="left">total</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1990</td><td align="left">18.7 (47%)</td><td align="left">16.6 (42%)</td><td align="left">4.2 (11%)</td><td align="left">39.5 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2000</td><td align="left">25.0 (56%)</td><td align="left">14.6 (33%)</td><td align="left">5.0 (11%)</td><td align="left">45.0 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2020</td><td align="left">36.6 (69%)</td><td align="left">09.0 (17%)</td><td align="left">7.4 (14%)</td><td align="left">53.0 (100%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Efficient (preventive)strategies are needed and urgent measures should be taken to control risk factors like tobacco, alcohol, obesity, blood pressure diet and inactivity. Otherwise, developing countries will be unable to provide their people with standard health care.</p><p>The costly and prolonged treatment of NCDs raises the equity problem between and within countries. As expressed by the WHO Director-General in his overview to the annual report[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], If a Japanese woman develop chronic diseases, excellent treatment and rehabilitation services will be available and she can expect to receive, on average, medications worth about US$ 550 per year and much more if needed. Meanwhile, a woman in Sierra Leone can expect, on average, medicines worth about US$ 3 per year and, if she survives middle age and develop chronic diseases then she will die prematurely as a consequence of inadequate treatment. The contrasts in opportunities of treatment exist also within developing countries; between poor and rich, cities and rural areas and also between men and women.</p><p>In previous papers, the authors proposed mathematical models dealing with the burden of diabetes and its complications[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Dynamics of a disabled population[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the effect of physical exercise[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and a model of dengue fever[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The present paper is devoted to the burden caused by NCDs in developing countries. In order to reverse the increasing trend of this burden (or at least to control it), the focus is made on the risk factors associated with these diseases.</p><p>Different methods can be considered to quantify the burden of NCDs. In order to overcome the specific problems of each country, the most used method is the approach that measures the global burden of NCDs in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) which is a combination of Years of Life Lost(YLL) through premature death, and Years Lived with Disability(YLD). Thus, DALY is thought of as one lost year of healthy life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]]. For example, deaths from underweight every year rob the world's poorest children of an estimated total of 130 million years of healthy life[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. According to this approach, the burden of adult NCDs account for 80% in developed countries and for 70% in middle-income countries. Even in the high-mortality regions of the world, almost 50% of the adult disease burden is attributable to NCDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Data from national registries and international sources are collected, compared and analyzed in order to show the trend of NCDs. Four diseases or cluster of diseases(Cardio-Vascular Diseases(CVDs), diabetes, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases) are considered to illustrate the growing burden of NCDs in developing countries. The main sources of data are the annual reports and regular publications released by the World Health Organization(WHO), World Heart Federation(WHF), Pan American Health Organization(PAHO), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), International Agency for Research on Cancer(IARC), Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control(CCDPC), International Task Force for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and a multitude of websites and papers dealing with NCDs. The literature associated with these diseases in developed countries is abundant. However, despite the encouraging programmes and joint projects proposed by WHO and other organisms in the form of collaborative research agreements to developing countries, in order to support national registries, unreliable and insufficient data are still prevailing in most of these countries. Moreover, the release of health data is shadowed by the security vision in some countries. Extrapolations are needed in the case of missing or incomplete data. Consequently, more efforts are needed to convince health decision makers in low- and middle-income countries of the necessity to develop epidemiological studies that allow for preventive strategies making health policy at the centre of sustainable development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>According the World Health Organization's statistics, chronic NCDs such CVDs, diabetes, cancers, obesity and respiratory diseases, account for about 60% of the 56.5 million deaths each year and almost half of the global burden of disease. In 1990, 47% of all mortality related to NCDs was in developing countries, as was 85% of the global burden of disease and 86% of the DALYs attributable to CVDs. An increasing burden will be born mostly by these countries in the next two decades. The socio-economic transition and the ageing trend of population in developing countries will induce further demands and exacerbate the burden of NCDs in these countries. If the present trend is maintained, it is predicted that, by 2020, NCDs will account for about 70 percent of the global burden of disease, causing seven out of every 10 deaths in developing countries, compared with less than half today.</p><p>In 1990, approximately 1.3 billion DALYs were lost as a result of new cases of disease and injury, with the major part in developing countries. In 2002, these countries supported 80% of the global YLDs due to the double burden of communicable and non communicable diseases. Consequently, their people are not only facing higher risk of premature life(lower life expectancy) but also living a higher part of their life in poor health[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These remarks indicate that NCDs are exacerbating health inequities existing between developed and developing countries and also making the gap more profound between rich and poor within low and middle-income countries.</p><sec><title>CVDs in developing countries</title><p>CVD is the name for the group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include hypertension (high blood pressure), coronary heart disease (heart attack), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathies. These diseases constitute the major contributor among NCDs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Deaths caused wordwide by specific diseases (&#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Deaths &#x00026; % <break/>Disease</td><td align="left">2002 [1]</td><td align="left">1990 [8]</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Ischaemic heart disease</td><td align="left">7000 (12.6%)</td><td align="left">6260 (12.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cerebrovascular disease</td><td align="left">5400 (09.6%)</td><td align="left">4380 (08.7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lower Respiratory Diseases</td><td align="left">3700 (06.6%)</td><td align="left">4300 (08.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">COPD</td><td align="left">2700 (04.8%)</td><td align="left">2211 (04.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cancer(all types)</td><td align="left">7100 (12.6%)</td><td align="left">6200 (11.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Diabetes</td><td align="left">3200 (05.6%)</td><td align="left">2400 (05.0%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Worldwide, an estimated 17 million people die of these diseases, particularly heart attacks and strokes, every year. Once associated with industrialized countries, CVDs are now emerging or rapidely increasing in developing countries. Indeed, in 1998, 86% of the DALYs caused by CVDs were attributed to developing countries and in 1999 CVDs contributed to a third of global deaths with 78% in low- and middle-income countries. The trend is increasing, indicating that by the year 2010 CVDs will be the leading cause of death in developing countries as a consequence of lifestyle changes brought about by industrialization and urbanization in developing countries engaged in the socio-economic transition. CVDs are promoted by risk factors like tobacco use, alcohol, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet. Unfortunately, the harm caused by these risk factors affects the rise of life expectancy in developing countries[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The costly and prolonged care of CVDs in low-and middle-income countries often divert the scarce family and societal resources to medical care. Consequently, the lower socio-economic groups have greater prevalence of risk factors, higher incidence of disease and higher mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Diabetes</title><p>The recent statistics released by the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation are alarming[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>](Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The number of diabetes in the world is expected to increase from 194 Million in 2003 to 330 in 2030 with three in four living in developing countries. Moreover, in developed countries most people with diabetes are above the age of retirement, whereas in developing countries those most frequently affected are aged between 35 and 64 which makes the burden in terms of DALYs and YLDs heavier in poorer countries. Indeed, in some countries of the Middle East, one in four deaths in adults aged between 35 and 64 years is attributable to diabetes. The burden is exacerbated by the complications such as blindness, amputations and kidney failure for which diabetes is the leading cause, and the interfering action of CVDs which are responsible for between 50 and 80% of deaths in people with diabetes. The burden of premature death from diabetes is similar to that of HIV/AIDS, yet the problem is largely unrecognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Diabetes prevalence (&#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) [13]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Country</td><td align="left">2000</td><td></td><td align="left">2030</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">India</td><td align="left">31.7</td><td align="left">India</td><td align="left">79.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">China</td><td align="left">20.8</td><td align="left">China</td><td align="left">42.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">United States</td><td align="left">17.7</td><td align="left">United States</td><td align="left">30.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Indonesia</td><td align="left">8.4</td><td align="left">Indonesia</td><td align="left">21.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Japan</td><td align="left">6.7</td><td align="left">Pakistan</td><td align="left">14.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Pakistan</td><td align="left">5.2</td><td align="left">Bangladesh</td><td align="left">11.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Russia</td><td align="left">4.6</td><td align="left">Brazil</td><td align="left">11.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Brazil</td><td align="left">4.5</td><td align="left">Japan</td><td align="left">8.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Italy</td><td align="left">4.2</td><td align="left">Italy</td><td align="left">5.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Bengladesh</td><td align="left">3.2</td><td align="left">Russia</td><td align="left">5.3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Studies in different countries have shown that diabetes is a costly disease accounting for between 2.5 and 15% of the total healthcare expenditure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

It is the most important established cause of cancer but also responsible in CVDs and chronic respiratory diseases.

Consequently, they promote CVDs, diabetes and many types of cancer. Worldwide, overweight affects 1.2 billion of which 300 million are clinically obese. In some developed countries like USA, the prevalence reaches 60% but developing countries like Kuwait have also a very high prevalence. More and more children are suffering from overweight and obesity. However, the most contrasting phenomenon is to find Overweight/Obesity and malnutrition side by side in low- and middle-income countries and hence contributing to the growing burden afflicting these countries. According to the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the WHO World Health report 2002, about 60% of diabetes globally can be attributable to overweight and obesity. In other respects, it is estimated that 60% of world's population do not do enough physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Alcohol[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]</title><p>Alcohol consumption has also increased in the last decades, with the major part of this increase imputable to developing countries.

Moreover, alcohol was estimated to cause 20 to 30 % of oesophagus cancer, liver disease, epilepsy, motor vehicle accidents and other hazards.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Non communicable diseases are more and more prevalent in developing countries. These diseases are highly correlated to risk factors like smoking, alcohol, obesity, diet and inactivity. The World Health Organization and many other organisms and associations are urging health decision makers to develop efficient preventive strategies to halt the growing trend of NCDs through the control of risk factors. However, although most of developed countries have reacted by pragmatic measures, the trend remain globally passive mainly because developing countries have been, so far, satisfied with adopting national conventions and adhering to international recommendations instead of pragmatic decisions such as prohibiting smoking in public areas, controlling alcohol abusers, encouraging physical activity, promoting healthy diet and improving primary health care for screening and early detection of chronic diseases. In these countries, 2.8 billion people live with less than 2 dollars, 1.2 billion live with less than one dollar and 1.3 billion live on fragile and often remote rural ecosystems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. So, the behaviour can be partly explained by lack of means and poor budget affected to health care but, in general, bad management and absence of goodwill assume a large part of responsibility. For instance, many developing countries have signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control(FCTC) and voted laws that prohibits smoking in public areas but the laws are not executed. Also, in the absence of early detection, many people are diagnosed at advanced stages of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes complications. Also, in these countries, until recently, it was widely believed that economic development was a necessary prerequisite for improving a population health status and the health was often classified as a non productive sector. Now, politicians and health policy makers are timidly recognizing that investing in people's health is a necessary condition for economic development but energetic decisions are needed for the adoption of urgent and consequent strategies. The need for such strategies is enhanced by the fact that risk factors like cholesterol, tobacco, blood pressure, and obesity are no more a specificity of industrialized countries, they are becoming more prevalent in developing nations, where they double the burden of infectious diseases that have always afflicted poorer countries. Moreover, multinational companies have been competing fiercely to expand their sales in developing countries and western lifestyle is invading middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Adhesion to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control(FCTC) and other international strategies must be taken seriously by developing countries facing the pandemics of
