<article-title>Unique Double-Barreled Enzyme Makes Methionine the Hard Way</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to <sc>L-</sc>homocysteine (Hcy) without using an intermediate methyl carrier. Although MetE displays no detectable sequence homology with cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH), both enzymes require zinc for activation and binding of Hcy. Crystallographic analyses of MetE from <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. maritima</named-content> reveal an unusual dual-barrel structure in which the active site lies between the tops of the two (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> barrels. The fold of the N-terminal barrel confirms that it has evolved from the C-terminal polypeptide by gene duplication; comparisons of the barrels provide an intriguing example of homologous domain evolution in which binding sites are obliterated. The C-terminal barrel incorporates the zinc ion that binds and activates Hcy. The zinc-binding site in MetE is distinguished from the (Cys)<sub>3</sub>Zn site in the related enzymes, MetH and betaine&#x02013;homocysteine methyltransferase, by its position in the barrel and by the metal ligands, which are histidine, cysteine, glutamate, and cysteine in the resting form of MetE. Hcy associates at the face of the metal opposite glutamate, which moves away from the zinc in the binary E&#x000b7;Hcy complex. The folate substrate is not intimately associated with the N-terminal barrel; instead, elements from both barrels contribute binding determinants in a binary complex in which the folate substrate is incorrectly oriented for methyl transfer. Atypical locations of the Hcy and folate sites in the C-terminal barrel presumably permit direct interaction of the substrates in a ternary complex. Structures of the binary substrate complexes imply that rearrangement of folate, perhaps accompanied by domain rearrangement, must occur before formation of a ternary complex that is competent for methyl transfer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>By solving the structure of MetE, the authors have shed light on how the chemically difficult transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine can occur</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Methionine synthases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from N5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate) to <sc>L</sc>-homocysteine (Hcy), the terminal step in the biosynthesis of methionine. Two apparently unrelated families of proteins catalyze this reaction: cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH; EC 2.1.1.13) and cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE; 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate&#x02013;homocysteine methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.14) Organisms that synthesize or transport B<sub>12</sub> encode the cobalamin-dependent enzyme whereas organisms that cannot obtain B<sub>12</sub> encode only the cobalamin-independent enzyme. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> and many other species of bacteria express both enzymes, but mammals utilize only cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase while plants and yeasts utilize only the cobalamin-independent enzyme.</p><p>MetH and MetE both face the same mechanistic challenge. They must catalyze the transfer of a very poor leaving group from the tertiary amine, CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate, to a relatively poor nucleophile, the sulfur of Hcy. MetH facilitates this transfer by using cobalamin as an intermediate methyl carrier [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cobalamin accepts a methyl group from CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate at one active site and donates it to Hcy at a second site [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, MetE appears to catalyze the direct transfer of the methyl group from CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate to Hcy [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This latter strategy seems to offer a less satisfactory answer to the mechanistic problems: measured k<sub>cat</sub> values for MetE are smaller than those for MetH by a factor of approximately 50&#x02013;100.</p><p>MetE and MetH both activate Hcy by binding the thiolate form of the substrate to Zn<sup>+2</sup> [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A similar strategy for alkylation of thiol groups is employed in protein farnesyltransferase [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], geranylgeranyltransferase [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], methanol:CoM methyltransferase (MtaA) [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> DNA repair Ada protein [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and betaine&#x02013;Hcy methyltransferase (BHMT) [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the sets of zinc ligands and the structures that house the zinc-binding sites are not conserved within this functional family. In particular, the metal ligands and their positions in the sequence are not the same in MetH and MetE. Three cysteines bind the essential zinc in MetH; the first cysteine ligand resides at the end of strand 6 of a (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> barrel, and the remaining vicinal cysteine ligands follow strand 8. A histidine and two cysteines have been identified as metal ligands in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> MetE by a combination of mutagenesis experiments [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The relative positions of these residues in the sequence led to the prediction that in a (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> MetE barrel the histidine and cysteine ligands would reside at the ends of strands 5 and 8 [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, the sequences of MetE enzymes give few if any clues to the strategy for binding and activation of folate by MetE. Thus, the mode of folate binding is a key question to be addressed by structure analysis. In both MetE and MetH, activation of the leaving group is thought to involve the protonation of CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate in a ternary complex, E&#x000b7;Hcy&#x000b7;CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate in MetE, or E&#x000b7;cob(I)alamin&#x000b7;CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate in MetH [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the residues that may facilitate protonation have not been identified for either enzyme.</p><p>MetE appears to have evolved through gene duplication of a sequence encoding a domain of approximately 340 residues that binds and activates Hcy. Within the family of MetE enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the N- and C-terminal halves exhibit significant sequence homology. The C-terminal half is more highly conserved than the N-terminal half and has homologs in archae and elsewhere. Among these thiol methyltransferases are several enzymes that are approximately half the size of MetE and utilize corrinoid proteins, rather than folates, as methyl donors. Taken together, these observations suggested that the MetE gene arose as the result of a primordial gene duplication event followed by loss of zinc- and Hcy-binding determinants from the duplicated sequence [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. If this hypothesis is correct, the two halves of the MetE sequence should display structural homology, and the N-terminal domain should be more closely related to the C-terminal domain than to any other protein in the database.</p><fig id="pbio-0030031-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Multiple Alignment of MetE from <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. maritima</named-content> (METE_THEMA), <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (METE_ECOLI), <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> (METE_YEAST), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. thaliana</named-content> (METE_ARATH)</title><p>Conservation in the N-terminal domain is indicated in aqua while conservation in the C-terminal domain is shown in yellow.

These barrels are topologically polar with their &#x0201c;tops&#x0201d; decorated by insertions that extend the &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b1; loop segments. MetE is the first example of a dual-(&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> barrel in which the decorated tops of the two barrels face each other to form a single active site that lies between the domains. A deep cleft between the barrels permits entry of the substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). As a result of the arrangement of the barrel domains, residues 352&#x02013;386 of the inter-barrel linker must span approximately 65 &#x000c5; to connect the bottoms of the two barrels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>The N- and C-terminal barrels share a number of strikingly similar features that provide structural evidence for gene duplication. Both barrels incorporate long extensions in the first four &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b1; loops but, with the exception of &#x003b1;8AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), lack insertions in the last four loops. A pseudo 2-fold axis superimposes these similar extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The helical extension at the start of &#x003b2;1&#x02013;&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;1AH, augments the side of the C-terminal barrel and is repeated in the N-terminal barrel. The &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;2 loops that appear in both barrels are the longest extensions in the structure, and we refer to them as the &#x0201c;long hairpin loops.&#x0201d; In the C-terminal barrel that binds Hcy and Zn<sup>+2</sup>, the long &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;2 loop begins with helix &#x003b1;2AH and then forms an antiparallel excursion that harbors a number of conserved residues, some of which are involved in binding folate. The &#x003b2;3&#x02013;&#x003b1;3 loops both include a short helix, &#x003b1;3A, that carries folate-binding determinants in the Hcy (C-terminal) barrel. The &#x003b2;4&#x02013;&#x003b1;4A segments of both barrels incorporate a conserved sequence, identified by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> MetE, this sequence, Gln-Ile-Asp-Glu-Pro-Ala, is identical in both barrels.</p><p>Despite the pseudosymmetry that relates the &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b1; loops of the two barrels, there are significant differences in the sequences and conformations of these connecting loops that distinguish the functional roles of the two barrels. The major binding determinants for the folate substrate lie primarily in the second, third, and fourth &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b1; loops of the C-terminal barrel. The equivalent binding site in the duplicated N-terminal barrel has been obliterated. Although the long &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;2 hairpin of the N-terminal barrel resembles the corresponding hairpin of the C-terminal (Hcy) barrel, the potential binding groove for the folate tail is closed by extensive hydrophobic contacts between &#x003b1;1AF, &#x003b1;1F, and &#x003b1;2CF and by interaction with the long hairpin of the C-terminal barrel. The positioning the long &#x003b2;2 hairpin significantly closer to the barrel top than in the C-terminal barrel occludes the pterin-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>Several other adaptations enhance the barrel&#x02013;barrel interface and appear to influence the relative orientations of the barrels. The &#x003b2;8&#x02013;&#x003b1;8 loop containing helix &#x003b1;8AF is 16 residues longer than the corresponding loop in the C-terminal domain and makes numerous inter-barrel contacts. Likewise, loop &#x003b2;4&#x02013;&#x003b1;4 in the C-terminal domain is extended by six residues, increasing contacts with the N-terminal barrel. The single-domain archaeal Hcy methyltransferases that are homologous to the C-terminal domain are missing these six residues, supporting the notion that this insert evolved to enlarge the inter-domain interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Zinc Site</title><p>The zinc-binding site of MetE is distinguished from most catalytic zinc sites by the presence of four protein ligands to zinc.

Binding of the substrate sulfur to zinc does not proceed by a simple dissociative reaction in which sulfur is substituted for the oxygen of Glu642. Instead, Hcy approaches the metal ion from the side opposite the Glu642 ligand. This mode of association is unusual; in most catalytic zinc sites the incoming substrate replaces a dissociable fourth ligand without inversion [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the structure of the binary complex determined at pH 5.2, displacement of Glu642 and inversion at Zn<sup>+2</sup> are incomplete. Zinc coordination changes from tetrahedral to distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and the substrate sulfur and glutamate oxygen both exhibit unusually long ligand&#x02013;metal distances: 3.15 &#x000c5; and 2.9 &#x000c5; for Zn&#x02013;S and Zn&#x02013;O, respectively.

The Zn&#x02013;S(Cys) and Zn&#x02013;N distances are not significantly altered, but the zinc and these three ligands become more nearly coplanar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

This distance is still long, and additional protein or substrate rearrangements would be necessary to close the gap between the sulfur of Hcy and the methyl carbon. An alternative route to a ternary complex that supports methyl transfer would be complete dissociation and reassociation of the CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate.

These small but significant conformation changes observed in the binary complexes precede larger rearrangements that must be induced by binding of both substrates to form a competent ternary complex.

His672, part of a conserved <sup>670</sup>Asp-Ile-His-Ser-Pro sequence, or Asp467, located in the DMV loop, may be positioned to serve as donors if protonation occurs after folate rearrangement.

The two domains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> MetE share a conserved Gln-Ile-Asp-Glu-Pro-Ala repeat [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and the sequences display 39% identity (50% similarity) within the regions now seen to span &#x003b2;3 to &#x003b1;4A of the two barrels. The pseudosymmetry of the structural features decorating the barrels provides compelling evidence for a close relationship between the two halves of MetE, verifying the inferences based on sequence alignments. The cores of (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> barrels, though they display characteristic distortions and can be classified into subgroups [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], do not provide as strong evidence for relatedness as do the similarities of regions inserted in intervening loops. It is difficult to ascertain whether the regions responsible for folate binding were inserted before or after gene duplication. The long &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;2 loop in the N-terminal barrel and corresponding sequences in archaeal relatives of MetE favor the notion that precursors of folate-binding segments were present before duplication. In any case, folate-binding determinants have developed or been retained primarily in the C-terminal Hcy barrel but not in its N-terminal replicate.</p><p>The idea that the zinc/Hcy barrel is the ancestral fold is based on several lines of evidence. This barrel shows significant structural homology to a broad family of zinc-dependent thiol methyltransferases, including not only MetH and BHMT but also the single-domain archaeal transferase enzymes that react with methylcobalamin. Indeed it seems likely that the three enzymes that convert Hcy to methionine, MetE, MetH, and BHMT, are all descended from a primordial zinc/Hcy barrel. In contrast, DALI searches that assess structural similarities [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reveal that the N-terminal barrel is more similar to the C-terminal barrel of MetE than to any other known protein, suggesting that its immediate precursor is the Hcy barrel of MetE.</p><p>Gene duplication of a Zn<sup>+2</sup>/Hcy barrel would have replicated the sites that bind Zn<sup>+2</sup> and Hcy, but these sites have been disabled in the N-terminal barrel of contemporary MetE. Disruption of zinc and Hcy binding is effected by both residue mutations and backbone conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Mutation of the equivalent of Cys620 in the Hcy barrel to Tyr232 leads to stacking with the adjacent Tyr233 (phenylalanine in most MetE sequences) and results in a major backbone conformational change. The hydroxyl group of the Tyr232 forms a hydrogen bond to Asn199 of the conserved Leu-Val-Asn-Glu-Pro-Ala sequence at the &#x003b2;4&#x02013;&#x003b1;4 loop and thus removes a crucial Hcy-binding determinant. Although Cys309, the equivalent of Cys704 of the C-terminal barrel, is retained in most MetE sequences, mutation of the other zinc ligands and many of the Hcy-binding residues leads to a complete overhaul of the binding site for Hcy.</p><fig id="pbio-0030031-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Disruption of Hcy and Zinc Binding in the N-Terminal Barrel</title><p>Overhaul of the Zn<sup>+2</sup>/Hcy site in the N-terminal domain (aqua) following gene duplication is accomplished through mutation and small backbone displacements. The competent Zn/Hcy site from the C-terminal barrel is at the left; the remodeled site from the N-terminal barrel is at the right. Important substitutions that disable Hcy and zinc binding are Trp146, Phe230, Tyr232, and Asp253 (see text).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030031.g008"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Why Is a Second Barrel Recruited for a Ternary Complex Mechanism?</title><p>Although an entire barrel domain is recruited to elicit direct methyl transfer from folate to Hcy, the structure reveals that the functional groups of this domain are mostly disabled. The binding determinants and potential catalytic residues are located primarily in extensions and excursions of the C-terminal Zn<sup>+2</sup>/Hcy barrel rather than in the &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; N-terminal domain. Duplication and divergence of an entire barrel is an elaborate strategy to accommodate a second relatively large substrate at a single active site, and MetE provides the first instance of the face-to-face barrel construction that is required to build such an active site. A more common strategy to accommodate a ternary complex is exemplified by the related Hcy methyltransferase, BHMT. In this enzyme the site for the rather small second substrate, betaine, is constructed in part from &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b1; barrel extensions and in part from a dimerization arm that is appended to the barrel and contributes to the active site of the partner chain of the functional dimer.</p><p>The N-terminal domain of MetE may nevertheless be essential for ternary complex formation and catalysis. In the family of thiol alkyltransferases, quenching of opposite charges on Hcy and the alkyl donor is believed to drive the reactions, and a hydrophobic environment [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and desolvation [<xref rid="pbio-0030031-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] of reactants may be critical for reactivity. Rearrangement of folate to form a viable ternary complex may be accompanied by rearrangement or closure of domains around the substrate-binding cleft that would reposition key residues and isolate the active site from solvent. Hcy binding is accompanied by a contraction of the top of the C-terminal barrel that alters the relative positions of the N- and C-terminal barrels. This small domain shift clearly gives hints of inter-domain flexibility. On the other hand, the commissioning of the N-terminal domain may reflect an evolutionary strategy in which gene duplication is utilized as the most facile way to recruit additional sequences. Structures of ternary complexes, obtained using mutant enzymes and/or substrate analogs, should provide further insights into the methyl transfer reaction and the functional roles of the N-terminal domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Cloning and purification</title><p>The TM1286 gene was PCR amplified from <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. maritima</named-content> genomic DNA (
