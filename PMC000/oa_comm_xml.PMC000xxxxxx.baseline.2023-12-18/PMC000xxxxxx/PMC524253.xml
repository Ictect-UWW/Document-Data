<article-title>Only Connect: The Functional Architecture of Brain Connectivity</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Complex brains have evolved a highly efficient network architecture whose structural connectivity is capable of generating a large repertoire of functional states. We detect characteristic network building blocks (structural and functional motifs) in neuroanatomical data sets and identify a small set of structural motifs that occur in significantly increased numbers. Our analysis suggests the hypothesis that brain networks maximize both the number and the diversity of functional motifs, while the repertoire of structural motifs remains small. Using functional motif number as a cost function in an optimization algorithm, we obtain network topologies that resemble real brain networks across a broad spectrum of structural measures, including small-world attributes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that highly evolved neural architectures are organized to maximize functional repertoires and to support highly efficient integration of information.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Analysis of characteristic patterns of connectivity in neuroanatomical datasets suggests that nervous systems evolved to maximize functional repertoires and support highly efficient integration of information</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The complex vertebrate brain has evolved from simpler networks of neurons over a time span of many millions of years.

The structural and functional anatomy of brain networks reflects the dual challenges of extracting specialized information and integrating the information in real time (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Tononi1" ref-type="bibr">Tononi and Sporns 2003</xref>).</p><p>What rules underlie the organization of the particular types of networks that we see in complex brains? It is likely that, as networks become more complex, already existing simpler networks are largely preserved, extended, and combined, while it is less likely that complex structures are generated entirely de novo. One hypothesis states that complex and highly evolved networks arise from the addition of network elements in positions where they maximize the overall processing power of the neural architecture. This could be achieved by increasing the number of existing processing configurations or by introducing new processing configurations that add to the robustness or range of cognitive and behavioral repertoires. We may gain insight into the rules governing the structure of complex networks by investigating their composition from smaller network building blocks. Those building blocks are called &#x0201c;motifs&#x0201d; (in analogy to driving elements that are elaborated in a musical theme or composition), and they have been examined in the context of gene regulatory, metabolic, and other biological and artificial networks (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Milo1" ref-type="bibr">Milo et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020369-Milo2" ref-type="bibr">Milo et al. 2004</xref>). Motifs occur in distinct motif classes that can be distinguished according to the size <italic>(M)</italic> of the motif, equal to the number of nodes (vertices), and the number and pattern of interconnections. For a more formal definition of motifs and related concepts, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p><p>While the most common definition of network motifs is based on their structural characteristics (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Milo1" ref-type="bibr">Milo et al. 2002</xref>), structural motifs of neuronal networks form the physical substrate for a repertoire of distinct functional modes of information processing. In brain networks, a structural motif may consist of a set of brain areas and pathways that can potentially engage in different patterns of interactions depending on their degree of activation, the surrounding neural context or the behavioral state of the organism. Thus, we propose a distinction between structural and functional motifs. Structural motifs quantify anatomical building blocks, whereas functional motifs represent elementary processing modes of a network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020369-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In this paper, functional motifs refer to specific combinations of nodes and connections (contained within structural motifs) that may be selectively recruited or activated in the course of neural information processing. Sorting all possible structural motifs within a network as a function of motif class yields a motif frequency spectrum that records the number of distinct motifs in each structural motif class. Given the motif frequency spectrum, one can easily obtain the motif number, defined as the total number of distinct occurrences of any motif of size <italic>M,</italic> and the motif diversity, defined as the number of classes that are represented within the network by at least one example.</p><fig id="pbio-0020369-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Definition of Structural and Functional Motifs, and Motif Detection</title><p>(A) From a network, we select a subset of three vertices and their interconnections, representing a candidate structural motif.</p><p>(B) The candidate motif is matched to the 13 motif classes for motif size <italic>M</italic> = 3. Numbers refer to the ID. The candidate motif is detected as a motif with ID = 13. In detecting structural motifs, only exact matches of candidate motif and motif class are counted.</p><p>(C) A single instance of a structural motif contains many instances of functional motifs. Here, a structural motif (<italic>M</italic> = 3, ID = 13) is shown to contain, for example, two distinct instances of the functional motif ID = 9, one motif ID = 2, and one motif ID = 7. Many other distinct instances of functional motifs are present that are not shown in the figure. Note that, in order to be counted as a functional motif of size <italic>M</italic> = 3, all three vertices of the original structural motif must participate. For a very similar distinction between structural and functional motifs (&#x0201c;interlaced circuits&#x0201d;) and an illustration see <xref rid="pbio-0020369-Ashby1" ref-type="bibr">Ashby (1960)</xref>, p. 53.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020369.g001"/></fig><p>Clearly, the number of vertices <italic>(N)</italic> and edges <italic>(K)</italic> within a large network has a strong effect on the motif number and diversity of its constituent structural and functional motifs. But even if <italic>N</italic> and <italic>K</italic> are held constant, different connection patterns will result in different repertoires of such network motifs, expressed in terms of both number and diversity. These considerations lead us to formulate hypotheses concerning the rules for brain network organization in terms of network motifs. We hypothesize that neuronal networks have evolved such that their repertoire of potential functional interactions (functional motifs) is both large and highly diverse, while their physical architecture is constructed from structural motifs that are less numerous and less diverse. A large functional repertoire facilitates flexible and dynamic processing, while a small structural repertoire promotes efficient encoding and assembly.</p><p>We investigate this hypothesis first by performing an analysis of structural and functional motifs in various brain networks. We compare the motif properties of real brain networks with random networks and with networks that follow specific connection rules such as neighborhood connectivity (lattice networks). We identify some motif classes that occur more frequently in real brain networks, as compared to random or lattice topologies. Second, by rewiring random networks and imposing a cost function that maximizes functional motif number, network topologies are generated that resemble real brain networks across a broad spectrum of structural measures, including small-world attributes. The results of our analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that complex brain networks maximize functional motif number and diversity while maintaining relatively low structural motif number and diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Motif Frequency Analysis</title><p>We obtained complete structural motif frequency spectra for large-scale connection matrices of macaque visual cortex, macaque cortex, and cat cortex, for motifs sizes of <italic>M</italic> = 2, 3, 4, and 5 (estimations).

<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020369-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the data for structural and functional motif number. Large-scale connection matrices exhibit a consistent statistical trend. Their structural motif number is relatively low, and their functional motif number is relatively high, with both measures approaching the corresponding values of lattice networks. All of these brain networks contain a very high proportion of connected motifs (e.g., 53.2% for <italic>M</italic> = 3 in macaque visual cortex versus 24.6% in corresponding random networks). All neuronal networks (all cortical networks and <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>) showed maximal functional motif diversity for all motif sizes examined (values of 2, 13, 199, and 9,364 for <italic>M</italic> = 2 to 5). Their structural motif diversity tended to be submaximal. For example, the structural motif diversity of macaque cortex was significantly reduced in comparison to random matrices (168, compared to 198 &#x000b1; 1 for random networks at <italic>M</italic> = 4).

Particularly noteworthy is the consistent appearance of motif ID = 9 (<italic>M</italic> = 3) in all cortical matrices examined in this study. The appearance of this motif cannot be explained by a higher proportion of reciprocal (mutual) edges (a motif of size <italic>M</italic> = 2): While random networks contain fewer such edges, lattice networks contain an equally high proportion of such edges (for example, macaque visual cortex has 69 single edges and 121 double edges, while a sample of 100 comparison lattice networks contains 70.6 &#x000b1; 4.71 single edges and 120.2 &#x000b1; 2.36 double edges).

In this paper we investigate the building blocks of brain networks and how their composition and topological patterning enables flexible neural function. Our hypotheses and analysis rest upon a fundamental distinction between structural and functional motifs. In this work, functional motifs refer to the different patterns or combinations of nodes and connections that could occur within the constraints of a given structural motif. We do not assume anything about their function, or which functional motif is actually selected by physiological mechanisms. We only assume that a particular structural motif is necessary to support a repertoire of functional motifs that may, or may not, be called upon for neuronal computations. Our hypothesis is that the connection patterns of real brain networks maximize functional motif number and diversity, thus ensuring a large repertoire of functional or effective circuits, while they minimize the number and diversity of structural motifs, thus promoting efficient assembly and encoding. We observe that the functional motif number of a variety of real brain networks is very high compared to equivalent random networks, while their structural motif number is comparably low. We then demonstrate that optimization of functional motif number can yield networks that resemble real brain networks in several structural characteristics, including their motif frequency spectra, motifs that occur in significantly increased numbers, and small-world measures.</p><p>The functional implications of some network structures&#x02014;such as reciprocal, convergent, and divergent connections or cycles&#x02014;have been discussed in the context of network participation indices (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Kotter2" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;tter and Stephan 2003</xref>) and network complexity (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Sporns5" ref-type="bibr">Sporns et al. 2000</xref>). Various large-scale cortical connection matrices examined in this study and collected by different authors and from different species, exhibit striking commonalities in their global patterning and motif compositions. Particularly interesting is the increased occurrence of a single motif at <italic>M</italic> = 3 (ID = 9; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020369-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and its expanded versions at <italic>M</italic> = 4 (ID = 46, 95, 148, 178). These motifs essentially form of a chain of reciprocally connected units, while pairs of connections linking the ends of the chain are absent. In functional terms, units in these motifs are highly integrated with their neighbors, while some pairs of units remain more segregated from each other and do not communicate directly. Thus, this motif type combines two major principles of cortical functional organization, integration and segregation (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Tononi3" ref-type="bibr">Tononi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020369-Friston1" ref-type="bibr">Friston 2002</xref>), and it may be associated with a specific type of neural dynamics (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Zhigulin1" ref-type="bibr">Zhigulin 2003</xref>). The occurrence of this motif type is not due to an artifact of recording or collating connection pathways, as it also appears in increased proportion in optimized and rewired networks (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020369-t004">Table 4</xref>). In contrast to large-scale cortical networks, the invertebrate network of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> exhibits very different patterns that are less indicative of high integration and segregation. At <italic>M</italic> = 3, motif ID = 9 does not occur in higher-than-expected numbers, while other motifs (ID = 4 and ID = 6) are increased. Our results suggest that large-scale cortical connection matrices form a distinct family (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Milo2" ref-type="bibr">Milo et al. 2004</xref>) of networks that can be characterized by their motif frequency spectra, while invertebrate neuronal networks do not appear to belong to this family.</p><p>Optimizing functional motif number yields networks that resemble real brain networks across a broad spectrum of structural measures, including several that did not appear to be linked in trivial ways to the optimized measure. Increasing the functional motif number tends to lead to a concomitant decrease in structural motif number, as individual connections become locally dense, thus increasing the abundance of motifs with more local connections and thus greater functional diversity. We note that maximal numbers of functional motifs are not reached in ideal lattices (nearest-neighbor connectivity); rather, optimized networks routinely exhibit functional motif numbers that exceed those of ideal lattices, and they belong to a general class of networks that maintain a mixture of &#x0201c;local&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;long-range&#x0201d; connectivity. Importantly, even though structural and functional motifs are directly related (each structural motif contains a fixed set and spectrum of functional motifs), optimizing structural and functional motif number yielded strikingly different connection topologies.</p><p>Optimizing functional (but not structural) motif number produced a tendency toward the emergence of small-world attributes (high clustering coefficient and short path length), a mode of connectivity that promotes functional cooperation, recurrent processing, and efficient information exchange (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Sporns6" ref-type="bibr">Sporns et al. 2004</xref>). High clustering is due to &#x0201c;locally dense&#x0201d; connectivity promoting fewer, denser, and functionally more potent motifs. An admixture of &#x0201c;long-range&#x0201d; connections, which is compatible with achieving very high functional motif number, serves to maintain short minimal paths throughout the network. Interestingly, networks optimized for complexity (<xref rid="pbio-0020369-Tononi2" ref-type="bibr">Tononi et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020369-Sporns5" ref-type="bibr">Sporns et al. 2000</xref>) also exhibit small-world attributes, conserve wiring length, and produce motif frequency spectra similar to those of networks optimized for functional motif number (including a significantly increased abundance of motif ID = 9, <italic>M</italic> = 3; unpublished data). In turn, networks optimized for functional motif number have significantly higher complexity than random networks, while those optimized for structural motif number are much less complex. Thus, it appears that several criteria for optimality (complexity, clustering coefficient, wiring length, functional motif number) favor similar global network architectures that are all characterized by two coexisting organizational principles, functional segregation and functional integration. The functional motif frequency spectrum provides a sophisticated way of characterizing subtypes of such networks geared at more specific functional modes of information processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Formal definitions</title><p>All networks and network motifs in this paper are described as graphs of units (called nodes or vertices) with directed (i.e., nonsymmetrical) connections (called edges).</p><p>A &#x0201c;motif&#x0201d; is a connected graph or network consisting of <italic>M</italic> vertices and a set of edges (maximally <italic>M</italic>

The resulting network of size <italic>M</italic> is called a &#x0201c;structural motif&#x0201d; because a larger network could be structurally assembled from a finite set of such motifs. Essentially, structural motifs form the structural building blocks of larger networks. Our definition of structural motifs is identical to the definition of motifs introduced in <xref rid="pbio-0020369-Milo1" ref-type="bibr">Milo et al. (2002)</xref>.</p><p>A structural motif provides the complete anatomical substrate for possible functional interactions among its constituent vertices. However, in real neuronal networks, not all structural connections participate in functional interactions at all times. As different edges or connections become functionally engaged, different &#x0201c;functional motifs&#x0201d; emerge within a single structural motif. The former (functional) refers to &#x0201c;processing modes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;effective circuits,&#x0201d; while the latter (structural) refers to &#x0201c;anatomical elements&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;building blocks.&#x0201d; The existence of different functional motifs greatly enhances the processing power of any neuronal architecture. We then distinguish structural motifs from functional motifs that form a set of subgraphs of the structural motif. All such functional motifs consist of the original <italic>M</italic> vertices of the structural motif, but contain only a subset of its edges (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020369-g001">Figure 1</xref>C for examples). Note that a fully connected structural motif such as ID = 13 for <italic>M</italic> = 3 contains the maximal number of functional motifs. For each exemplar of a structural motif of a specific motif class, there is a fixed complement of constituent potential functional motifs (essentially forming a look-up table of potential functional circuits). Thus, the functional motif frequency spectrum is easily obtained from the structural motif frequency spectrum, without the need for additional motif detection.</p><p>This definition implies that functional motifs are more naturally applied to networks with vertices that contain multiple neurons or neuronal populations.
