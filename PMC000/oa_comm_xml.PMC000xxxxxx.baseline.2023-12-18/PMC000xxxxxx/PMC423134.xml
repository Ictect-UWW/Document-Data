<article-title>Integrin Bidirectional Signaling: A Molecular View</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Conformational communication across the plasma membrane between the extracellular and intracellular domains of integrins is beginning to be defined by structural work on both domains. However, the role of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit transmembrane domains and the nature of signal transmission through these domains have been elusive. Disulfide bond scanning of the exofacial portions of the integrin &#x003b1;<sub>II&#x003b2;</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> transmembrane domains reveals a specific heterodimerization interface in the resting receptor. This interface is lost rather than rearranged upon activation of the receptor by cytoplasmic mutations of the &#x003b1; subunit that mimic physiologic inside-out activation, demonstrating a link between activation of the extracellular domain and lateral separation of transmembrane helices. Introduction of disulfide bridges to prevent or reverse separation abolishes the activating effect of cytoplasmic mutations, confirming transmembrane domain separation but not hinging or piston-like motions as the mechanism of transmembrane signaling by integrins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Integrin receptors mediate cell-matrix interactions by altering the conformation of their intra- and extra- cellular domains, a process mediated by lateral separation of the transmembrane helices</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrins are major metazoan cell adhesion receptors that have the distinctive property of transducing signals across the plasma membrane in both directions. Intracellular binding of cytoskeletal components to integrin cytoplasmic domains activates the ligand binding competency of the extracellular domain (inside-out signaling). Furthermore, ligand binding to integrin extracellular domains is coupled to alterations in cytoplasmic domains that are linked to downstream signaling (outside-in signaling). The three-dimensional architecture of integrin extracellular domains as well as their rearrangement in activation have been revealed by crystal, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electron microscopic methods (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Xiong2" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Adair1" ref-type="bibr">Adair and Yeager 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Beglova1" ref-type="bibr">Beglova et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Takagi2" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Takagi3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).

This finding demonstrated separation of the cytoplasmic domains; however, whether signal transmission through integrin transmembrane (TM) domains involves hinging or pistoning motions or lateral separation in the plane of the membrane has yet to be definitively established (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Lu2" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Takagi1" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Takagi2" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Gottschalk1" ref-type="bibr">Gottschalk et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, there are no experimental data on how the two integrin TM segments associate.

However, heterodimeric association between integrin &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit fragments containing the TM and cytoplasmic domains has thus far not been detected in either detergent micelles (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Li1" ref-type="bibr">R. Li et al. 2001</xref>) or lipid bilayers, and association between the TM domains has never been demonstrated in intact cells. Since glycophorin A TM domains dimerize in lipid and detergent micelles (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Lemmon1" ref-type="bibr">Lemmon et al. 1992</xref>) under conditions similar to those under which integrin TM domains fail to heterodimerize, it has been proposed that the interaction between the integrin TM domains is less stable (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Gottschalk1" ref-type="bibr">Gottschalk et al. 2002</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Li3" ref-type="bibr">R. Li et al. (2003)</xref> reported that both the integrin &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits' TM helices have the potential to undergo homomeric rather than heteromeric interactions, and that stabilization of homooligomerization of integrin TM segments results in integrin activation. Li et al. hypothesize that the homomeric associations between TM segments provide a driving force for integrin activation. Experimental data on the association between integrin TM domains in intact cells are clearly required to decide between the many different models for how conformational signals are transmitted through the membrane in integrins.</p><p>Here we present extensive experimental evidence using cysteine mutagenesis and disulfide bond formation that integrin &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; TM segments associate with each other with a specific spatial orientation in the resting state. Mutations in the &#x003b1; subunit cytoplasmic tail known to universally activate integrins disrupt the heterodimeric TM domain interaction, but do not result in homomeric interaction. The effects of activating mutations are reversed by disulfide bond formation between &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM domains. The results suggest that lateral separation of TM segments is responsible for the initial conversion to the high-affinity receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Structure of the TM Domain of Integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> in the Resting State</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Cysteine scanning of integrin TM domains</title><p>Inspection of the primary sequences of integrin subunits readily identifies putative TM segments of approximately 23 hydrophobic amino acids, as widely reported in the literature and as confirmed using a hidden Markov model approach (TMHMM version 2.0) (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Krogh1" ref-type="bibr">Krogh et al. 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Mutant &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> chains were then cotransfected into 293T cells, biosynthetically labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine and cysteine, and chased for 17 h with medium containing 500 &#x003bc;g/ml of cysteine and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of methionine. Detergent cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to the &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> complex and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel elecrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Because of the extensive chase, only mature, cell-surface &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> with complex N-linked glycan was isolated, which can readily be distinguished from the lower M<sub>r</sub> &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> precursors with high mannose N-linked glycans (data not shown). When the two cysteines on the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits are spatially close and are oxidized during biosynthesis, they form a disulfide bridge that can be detected by the appearance of a covalently attached &#x003b1;&#x003b2; heterodimer band in nonreducing SDS-PAGE with a concomitant decrease in the intensity of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; monomer bands (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 5 compared to 1). Cysteines located near one another in the extracellular environment or in the membrane near the extracellular surface form disulfide bonds during the normal course of protein biosynthesis and processing.

The disulfide bonding efficiency of all of these pairs is graphically summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>B.

For example, cysteine pair &#x003b1;-P965C/&#x003b2;-I693C formed a disulfide-bonded dimer with an apparent molecular weight of 200 kDa at greater than 95% efficiency even without Cu-phenanthroline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that these two residues are in close proximity to each other near the exofacial membrane surface. The second group includes 13 pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, asterisk) that formed disulfides that increased in efficiency by 10% or more upon treatment with oxidant. For example, the efficiency of disulfide formation by the &#x003b1;-V971C/&#x003b2;-L697C pair was about 5% in the absence of oxidant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 7) and about 70% after treatment of cells with Cu-phenanthroline at 0 &#x000b0;C for 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 8). The residues that formed disulfide bonds with increased efficiency after Cu-phenanthroline treatment are located deeper in the plasma membrane.

Both the overall disulfide-bond-forming efficiency of individual residues and the pattern of disulfide bond formation are consistent with a unique orientation between the two helices in terms of both the faces of the two helices that are apposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, upper portion) and the relation between the two helices in their axial directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, lower portion). Furthermore, the axial relationship deduced from this pattern is identical to that obtained by assuming that the boundary between residues that form constitutive and inducible disulfide bonds should be at the same depth in the membrane for both helices (gray dashed line in the lower portion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Single and double cysteine mutants are in the low-affinity state</title><p>On both CHO-K1 (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Kashiwagi1" ref-type="bibr">Kashiwagi et al. 1999</xref>) and 293T transfectants, &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> has low affinity for soluble ligand.

(1) No periodicity in disulfide formation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). The only pattern was that the more N-terminal exofacial residues preferentially bonded to more exofacial residues in the other subunit, whereas more buried residues preferentially bonded to more buried residues in the other subunit. The lack of periodicity is highly unlikely to result from a loss of helical secondary structure in such a large portion of the TM domains (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Li4" ref-type="bibr">S. C.

During biosynthesis at 37 &#x000b0;C, the membrane is fluid. Disulfide bond formation is catalyzed in the endoplasmic reticulum by disulfide isomerases, and because the redox balance is oxidizing in the endoplasmic reticulum, disulfide bond formation can covalently trap protein complexes that form only transiently. Therefore, a complex that would not be stable energetically by noncovalent interactions alone may nonetheless be stabilized by a covalent disulfide bond. This may particularly be the case for interactions between integrin TM domains, because the noncovalent association between the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits in the headpiece in the extracellular domain increases the probability of collision between the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM domains. If disulfide formation is the result of a stable noncovalent interaction between TM domains, it should occur at 0 &#x000b0;C when membranes are in a gel phase and proteins do not diffuse, as well as at 37 &#x000b0;C when membranes are liquid-crystalline and proteins diffuse.

This strongly supports the hypothesis that association of the TM segments in the &#x003b1;*/&#x003b2; receptor is not energetically favored&#x02014;and is thus present only in an undetectably small subpopulation of molecules at any one moment&#x02014;but is a kinetically accessible state in a fluid membrane at 37 &#x000b0;C that can be trapped by disulfide formation.

This result is inconsistent with the notion that homooligomerization of TM domains occurs concomitantly with separation of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM domains and represents the major mechanism for inside-out activation of integrins.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>TM Helix Separation Is Responsible for Activation of Integrins from within the Cell</title><p>As described above, integrins with disulfide-linked TM domains can be activated from the outside by Mn<sup>2+</sup> and mAb; however, we now demonstrate that such a linkage prevents activation from the inside. We first examined the activation state of receptors with activating &#x003b1;* or &#x003b1;" mutations that constitutively form disulfide bonds during biosynthesis. When &#x003b1;*-W968C was coexpressed with &#x003b2;-I693C, nearly 100% formation of the intersubunit disulfide linkage was observed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, lane 4). This cross-linked receptor showed low basal ligand binding activity, like the wild-type receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

The disulfide cross-link had no deleterious effect on ligand binding itself because, as already mentioned above, &#x003b1;*-W968C/&#x003b2;-I693C bound ligand upon activation by Mn<sup>2+</sup> and activating mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Furthermore, in &#x003b1;*-W968C/&#x003b2;-I693C but not in &#x003b1;*-W968C/&#x003b2;wt or &#x003b1;*/&#x003b2;-I693C (data not shown), the exposure of activation-dependent epitopes was reduced to the level of the wild-type receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).

However, the chimeras that were assayed contain truncated integrin TM domains with only 17 residues of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM domains, lack the GFFKR motif demonstrated here to be required for physiologic TM domain association, and insert as type II rather than type I membrane proteins.

However, the use of the glycophorin template (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-MacKenzie1" ref-type="bibr">MacKenzie et al. 1997</xref>) to fit our experimental data demonstrates that the GVMAG dimerization interface is more equivalent to &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>-W968/VLVG and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-V696/LLSV (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>Our cysteine cross-linking data not only define the nature of the interface between the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM domains within integrin heterodimers but also provide information about the spatial relationship between neighboring integrin heterodimers on the cell surface. The formation of a cross-link between the &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> subunits of two neighboring integrin molecules by the &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>-W967C mutant demonstrates the lateral accessibility of this site in the resting state. Consistent with this finding, our data demonstrate that the &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>-W967 residue points away from the TM interface with the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> subunit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). It further should be noted that in the bent, low-affinity integrin conformation present on the cell surface (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Takagi2" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al. 2002</xref>), the headpiece is folded such that the juxtamembrane portion of the &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> subunit, including Trp967, is exposed, whereas the juxtamembrane segment of &#x003b2; is occluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

The &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; residues mutated to cysteine in active receptors spanned two and three &#x003b1;-helical turns in the &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> TM domains, respectively. The same mutations in resting receptors robustly disclosed heterodimeric interactions. Therefore, if homodimeric interactions between the TM domains were present, they should have been detected. Why were homodimer interactions observed in the resting state, albeit only through cross-linking of one residue, and not in the active state? A full answer to this question would require more knowledge about the dynamics of integrins on cell surfaces; however, based on observations on the heterogeneity of integrin structure from quantitative negative stain electron microscopy of soluble integrins (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Takagi2" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al. 2002</xref>), a preliminary answer can be proposed. These studies reveal that the integrin adopts a single homogenous, bent conformation in the resting state. By contrast, in the extended conformation, there are two discrete angles between the &#x003b2; subunit I-like and hybrid domains. Furthermore, the region between the &#x003b2; subunit hybrid domain and the TM domain, which contains four I-EGF domains and the &#x003b2;-tail domain, is quite flexible. Therefore, motion of the headpiece may sweep out a large area and prevent neighboring integrins from coming close. Moreover, motions of the membrane proximal &#x003b1; subunit calf-2 domain relative to the &#x003b1; TM domain and of the &#x003b2;-tail domain relative to the &#x003b2; TM domain would also be much greater after TM domain and tailpiece separation, and would also hinder the close approach of other TM domains.</p><p>What about observations that integrin fragments consisting of the TM and cytoplasmic domains form dimers (&#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>) and trimers (&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>) in detergent micelles (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Li1" ref-type="bibr">R. Li et al. 2001</xref>)? We think that these findings should be interpreted with caution. It is important to point out that the physiological, heterodimeric interaction between the &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> TM domains cannot be reconstituted in the same detergents, i.e., in sodium dodecyl sulfate or dodecylphosphocholine (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Li1" ref-type="bibr">R. Li et al. 2001</xref>). There are many important differences between dodecyl detergent micelles and lipid bilayers, including a shorter hydrocarbon chain (12 versus 16 or 18), one (as opposed to two) fatty acyl chains per headgroup, and a spherical (as opposed to a bilayer) shape. The same characteristics that prevent physiological heterodimeric integrin TM interactions in dodecyl detergent micelles may conspire to cause nonphysiologic homomeric interactions. A &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-G708N mutation increases trimerization in detergent by more than 10-fold and is also reported to activate ligand binding in transfectants (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Li3" ref-type="bibr">R. Li et al. 2003</xref>); however, &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> trimerization in membrane bilayers or intact cells has yet to be demonstrated. In 293T transfectants the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-G708N mutation fails to detectably activate soluble ligand binding by &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We could confirm that the G708N mutation in CHO cells increased ligand binding, but to a level only 17% of that of the maximally activated receptor, whereas the G708L mutation is maximally activating (data not shown). Gly708 is in the TM heterodimer interface defined here, and we have additional unpublished data suggesting that the weak activating effect of the G708N mutation is a consequence of the disruption of this interface. The lack of homomeric disulfide cross-linking of integrin &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM domains found here with activated &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> in intact cells strongly suggests that integrin activation from inside the cell is not sufficient to drive homomeric interactions. Studies with fluorescent resonance energy transfer probes attached to integrin cytoplasmic domains also fail to find homomeric interactions when integrins are activated from within the cell or bind to monomeric ligand outside the cell (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2003</xref>; M. Kim, C. Carman, and T. Springer, unpublished data). However, we should point out that binding to multimeric ligands induces integrin clustering (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Buensuceso1" ref-type="bibr">Buensuceso et al. 2003</xref>) and that we have not examined homomeric interactions under these conditions. In conclusion, our results suggest that lateral separation of the TM segments of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chains leads to affinity upregulation within a single receptor molecule without facilitating &#x003b1;&#x02013;&#x003b1; or &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b2; interactions. Therefore, if the tendency of integrin TM domains to undergo homomeric interactions in detergent micelles also holds for lipid bilayers, it may strengthen adhesion and contribute to outside-in signaling after the initial engagement of multimeric physiological ligands.</p><p>Our results show that the &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> TM domains are associated in a specific manner in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer in the resting state and are unassociated in the active state. Upon activation, association between the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits is also broken at the interface between the TM and cytoplasmic domains (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Vinogradova2" ref-type="bibr">Vinogradova et al. 2002</xref>), and furthermore, the cytoplasmic domains also separate (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2003</xref>). The simplest explanation for separation at all three of these locations is separation of the TM domains in the plane of the membrane. Perhaps a counterargument could be made that a hinge-like motion of the TM domains relative to one another about a pivot point near the middle of the bilayer would also give rise to separation at each of these three positions. We point out that only one specific TM hinge model has been proposed, that it does not give rise to separation in the TM regions scanned in this study (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Gottschalk1" ref-type="bibr">Gottschalk et al. 2002</xref>), that our data rule it out, and that much more extreme hinging is unprecedented and is unlikely, because the size of the TM interface would be markedly decreased and hence less likely to stabilize association.</p><p>Bidirectional signal transmission by integrins across the plasma membrane is not necessarily symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">Figure 7</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">7</xref>D compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">7</xref>E&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">7</xref>H). We show that separation of the TM domains is sufficient to prime the extracellular domain for ligand binding and exposes activation epitopes that report the switchblade-like extension of the extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">Figure 7</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">7</xref>D). Furthermore, prevention or reversal of TM domain separation abolishes priming and extension signaled from the inside.

The implication is that with the wild-type receptor, under conditions in which high concentrations of ligand drive the equilibrium toward ligand binding, ligand could bind in the absence of TM domain separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">Figure 7</xref>G) and subsequently drive TM domain separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">Figure 7</xref>H).

This very tight linkage between the C-terminal extracellular domains and the TM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">Figure 7</xref>I) implies that separation of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; TM domains would also lead to separation of the membrane proximal &#x003b1; calf-2 and &#x003b2;-tail domains in the integrin tailpiece. In turn, this separation in the tailpiece would destabilize the extensive interface with the headpiece and lead to switchblade opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020153-g007">Figure 7</xref>J) (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Takagi2" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>Separation of TM domains in the plane of the membrane is a novel mechanism for activation of a cell surface receptor. One of the best-known mechanisms for receptor activation, exemplified by receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Schlessinger1" ref-type="bibr">Schlessinger 2000</xref>), works in almost the opposite manner, in which distinct or identical receptor subunits are brought together in a specific orientation in the plane of the membrane by ligand binding. In the neu (ErbB-2) member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, enforced dimerization along a series of &#x003b1;-helical TM dimer interfaces gives rise to periodicity in activation, such that dimerization only in certain orientations is activating (<xref rid="pbio-0020153-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">Burke and Stern 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">Bell et al. 2000</xref>). In our study, the &#x003b1;*&#x003b2; and &#x003b1;"&#x003b2; receptors with activating mutations were captured with disulfide bonds in many different rotational orientations between the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM &#x003b1; helices. Similarly, disulfide bonding between cysteines located at different depths in the membrane would be expected to give rise to some piston-like motion of one helix relative to the other. It is notable that none of the enforced orientations between disulfide-bonded &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; integrin TM domains were activating. These results argue against hinging, rotation, or piston models in which a relative change in orientation between the two TM domains is activating, and are in agreement with the model that separation of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM domains in the plane of the membrane is the activation mechanism.</p><p>Integrins in the extended conformation have their ligand binding site far above the plasma membrane, as appropriate for binding to ligands in the extracellular matrix and on opposing cell surfaces. However, transmission of conformational information over such distances is inefficient, because it is attenuated by interdomain flexibility. Integrins solve the problem of long distance communication by equilibrating between an extended conformation and a bent conformation, and by altering the equilibrium between these conformations by the novel mechanism of separation of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit TM domains.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Plasmid construction and transient transfection</title><p>Plasmids coding for full-length human &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> were subcloned into pEF/V5-HisA and pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+), respectively, as described by <xref rid="pbio-0020153-Takagi2" ref-type="bibr">Takagi et al.
