The objective of the current studies was to examine the role of caspase 3 (CPP32) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) in the signaling of genistein-and &#x003b2;-lapachone (bLap)-induced apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells PC3.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both genistein and bLap produced dose-dependent growth inhibition and treatment-induced apoptosis in PC3.

The incidence of prostate cancer increases most rapidly with age, and multiple genetic and epigenetic factors have been implicated in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of prostate cancer. Nevertheless, scientific knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease is still limited.</p><p>The problem often faced with the clinical management of prostate cancer is derived not only from the fact that no single gene or molecule can serve as a reliable marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but also that there is still no effective therapeutic regimen available without serious, sometimes fatal side effects. Unfortunately, at the time of clinical diagnosis, human prostate cancers mostly present themselves as heterogeneous entities &#x02013; hormone-dependent and hormone-independent, and proliferating and non-proliferating. The tumor re-growth that occurs after post-treatment remission is largely due to progression of initially androgen-dependent to androgen-independent cancer cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and/or non-proliferating to proliferating tumor cells. Therefore chemotherapeutic strategies should focus on eradicating all cancer cells irrespective of state of growth or sensitivity to hormone. This calls for a search for drug combination treatment that works through different mechanism of action. The facts that prostate cancer cells retain the inherent apoptotic machinery potentially subject them to an appropriate efficacious chemotherapeutic intervention.</p><p>The molecular mechanism(s) and intracellular mediators of both spontaneous-and treatment-induced apoptosis are not fully elucidated. However, evidence from several research investigations seem to indicate that a variety of stimuli, including physiological, pathologic, environmental or cytotoxic, can trigger the process of apoptosis in many mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and that both apoptosis and necrosis may share some upstream events in the molecular pathways that lead to induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. An emerging strategy for cancer chemotherapy is the choice of drugs that induce apoptosis and/or disruption of angiogenesis with eventual elimination of the cancer. It is suggested that blocking of caspase activation in an apoptotic process may divert apoptotic cell death to a necrotic demise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; implying that apoptosis and necrosis may share some upstream events in the molecular pathways of apoptosis induction. Among the dietary phytochemicals of potential therapeutic significance, are genistein isoflavone and &#x003b2;-lapachone, both of which induce apoptosis and also inhibit angiogenesis (genistein) in an array of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Genistein isoflavone [4',5',]-trihydroxyisoflavone) is a metabolite of soy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and has a heterocyclic, diphenolic structure similar to estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The phytochemical isoflavonoid family to which genistein belongs is a group of plant chemicals that resemble steroid estrogens and mimic their biological reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Several clinical studies indicate that genistein has some chemoprotective and chemotherapeutic potential against many tumors, including prostate, breast, and colon cancers through several mechanisms of action including: apoptosis induction; modulation of cell cycle activity by arresting cell cycle at the G<sub>2</sub>-M stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; inhibition of DNA topoisomerase-II and tyrosine protein kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the catalytic domain of tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; stimulating the production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which may lower the risk of hormone related cancers by decreasing the amount of free and active hormones in the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The other phytochemical of potential therapeutic significance is &#x003b2;-lapachone [3, 4-dihydro-2, 2-dimethyl-2H-naphtol (1,2-b) pyran-5,6-dione], a simple plant product with a chemical structure different from currently used anti-cancer drugs. It has been previously demonstrated that the primary mode of cytotoxicity of &#x003b2;-Lapachone is through the induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Structural similarities between &#x003b2;-lapachone and other members of the naphthoquinone family, such as menadione, suggest that the enzyme, NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase enzyme (NQO1) may be involved in the activation or detoxification of &#x003b2;-lapachone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>While a number of <italic>in vitro </italic>effects of &#x003b2;-lapachone and genistein have been described, knowledge of the key intracellular targets of &#x003b2;-lapachone and genistein is limited. Recent reports have suggested that by &#x003b2;-lapachone-induced apoptosis is non-caspase mediated in breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and that the cytotocxicity of this compound is dependent on the activity of NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase enzyme (NQO1/xip3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. B-Lapachone has been shown to be an inhibitor of DNA repair that sensitizes cells to DNA-damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It directly inhibits DNA topoisomerase I and II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and induces a cell-cycle delay in G<sub>1 </sub>and/or S phase followed by apoptotic and/or necrotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The apoptosis induced by &#x003b2;-lapachone is p53 independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and has been associated with upregulation of Bak as well as cleavage of caspase-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and caspase 3 in a variety of mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to determine the potential chemosensitivity of human prostate adenocarcinoma, PC3 cells to &#x003b2;-lapachone and Genistein and the role of caspase 3 (CPP32) and NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase enzyme (NQO1) in the signaling of &#x003b2;-Lapachone and genistein-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. The hypothesis is that combination treatment with the two phytochemicals will be strongly preventive and/or interceptive against prostate cancer by modulating epigenetic events (apoptosis) associated with the progression of active and latent cancer cells to clinical malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genistein and &#x003b2;-lapachone inhibit growth and proliferation of human prostate carcinoma cells, PC3</title><p>Human prostate carcinoma cells PC3, was used to determine the chemosensitivity of prostate cancer to genistein isoflavone and &#x003b2;-lapachone <italic>in vitro </italic>using Trypan blue exclusion, LDH and MTS bioassays.

Data from this study demonstrate significant inhibition of cell growth and proliferation in PC3 cells, with significant difference in chemosensitivity of PC3 to genistein and &#x003b2;-lapachone (P &#x0003c; 0.01). Furthermore, growth inhibition of PC3 cells strongly correlated with the MTS and LDH assay results. The pattern of response and percent post-treatment live cells was consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The genistein-and bLap-induced morphological changes observed in the cells were identical in pattern but differed in severity at a given exposure time; indicative of differences in chemosensitivity of PC3 to genistein and &#x003b2;-lapachone. These observations were consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that &#x003b2;-lap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] induces morphologic changes indicative of apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Similar alterations in morphology including cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation in the PC3 cells following single and combination treatment with &#x003b2;-lapachone and genistein isoflavone.</p><p>The present data also implicates caspase-3 protease, CPP32, in the molecular pathway of genistein-induced apoptosis in prostate PC3 cancer cells, consistent with previous investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Using the caspase inhibitor DEVD-fmk, caspase activity was arrested concurrent with significant decrease in genistein-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. However, it is noteworthy that inhibition of caspase did not confer 100% protection against genistein-induced apoptosis; implying alternative death pathways, which suggests that some death receptor signals do not utilize the caspase CPP32 death pathways in PC3. We have previously demonstrated the significant role of caspase-3 protease in the genistein-induced apoptosis pathway in both testes and prostate (PC3) cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The present data indicate a possible alternate CPP32 pathway in bLap-induced apoptosis in PC3. However, unlike the observation in genistein-induced apoptosis, blocking the CPP32 activity with the specific caspase inhibitor, DEVD-fmk, did not significantly change the percentage of bLap-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells; indicating that CPP32 many not be the main death pathway of bLap-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. Activation of the caspase 3 in bLap-induced apoptosis has been reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The potential role of NAD(P)H:quinone oxydoreductase (NQO1) activity in genistein-and bLap-induced apoptosis in PC3 was investigated. Co-culture of PC3 cells with dicoumarol, a specific inhibitor of NQO1 activity, significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of &#x003b2;-Lapachone in PC3 cells, as reflected in the significant reduction in the percentage of treatment-induced apoptosis. Dicoumarol increased cell survival. These results implicate NQO1 as the main target in bLap-induced apoptosis in PC3, consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, the fact that blocking of NQO1 did not confer 100% protection against induction of apoptosis indicates a possible alternate pathway in bLap-induced apoptosis. The present data indicate some involvement of caspase protease CPP32, though not with the same significance as NQO1. The activation of cysteine protease has been observed after bLap treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Pink et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported activation of the cysteine protease in MCF-7 and T4D breast cancer cells in bLap-induced apoptosis.</p><p>Contrary to the observation in bLap-induced apoptosis, blocking NQO1 activity did not significantly influence genistein-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells; implying NQO1 may not be the major target in genistein-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. However, the overall data indicate a synergistic effect of genistein-bLap combination treatment of PC3 and, that the major target in the combination treatment-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells is NQO1. Investigation into genistein/bLap synergism in a number human cancer cells is on-going.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is concluded from the data obtained that: i) both genistein and bLap exert growth inhibition effects in PC3 cells, with significant differences in chemosensitivity of PC3 to the two agents; ii) there is a manifestation of synergism between genistein-bLap combination treatment; iii) both genistein and bLap induce apoptosis in PC3 cells; iv) the major target in genistein-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells seems to be CPP32; v) the major molecular target in bLap-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells appear to be NQO1; vi) the major target in the genistein-bLap combination treatment-induced apoptosis appears to be NQO1; and vii) combination treatment appears significantly more efficacious than single treatments. More extensive studies are ongoing to delineate and clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the combination effects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Genistein isoflavone (Indoline Chemical Co.

All cells were grown and maintained as monolayers in 25 m<sup>2 </sup>tissue culture flasks (Sigma Scientific, St. louis, MO, USA) in RPMI 1640 containing 15 mM HEPES, and supplemented with 0.45% glucose (w/w), 5.0% FBS and 100 U<sup>. </sup>mL<sup>-1 </sup>penicillin + 100 mg<sup>. </sup>ml<sup>-1 </sup>streptomycin. The cells were then harvested by gentle scraping with a cell scraper. The cell suspensions were then grown at a density of 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well in 24-well microtiter plates (MTP) for 36 hr to allow adherence. The supernatants were discarded and the agents (Gn or bLap) were added over a range of 5 cytotoxic concentrations in single and combination treatments. In preliminary studies with bL<sub>1-8</sub>, the IC<sub>50 </sub>ranged between 1.8&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;M for a number of cells.

Cell Viability Assays</title><sec><title>A1.1 MTS assay</title><p>MTS assay depends on mitochondrial enzyme reduction of MTS solution to detect and determine cell viability. The MTS cell proliferation assay is a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation. It is composed of solutions of a tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS] and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine ethosulfate; PES). MTS is bioreduced by the cells into formazan product that is soluble in cell culture medium. Following cell culture as described above, 100 &#x003bc;L of cells were harvested from each treatment group and added to a 96 MTP followed by addition of 20 &#x003bc;l of MTS (2.5 mg/mL: Sigma Chemical Co) stock solution to each well. After 2 hr incubation under standard conditions of 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 37&#x000b0;C, the purple formazan product (indicative of reduction of MTS) was visible. The absorbance was read on Multiskan biochromatic automated microplate reader (Multiskan, DC) at 490 nm. The signal generated (color intensity) is directly proportional to the number of viable (metabolically active) cells in the wells. Relative cell numbers can therefore be determined based on the optical absorbance (optical density, OD) of the sample. The blank values were subtracted from each well of the treated cells and controls; and the mean and standard error for each treatment (singles and combination) were calculated relative to the control:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="1475-2867-4-5-i1.gif"/></p><p>where A<sub>C </sub>= absorbance of the control (mean value): A<sub>T </sub>= absorbance of the treated cells (mean value)</p><p>A<sub>B </sub>= absorbance of the blank (mean value)</p></sec><sec><title>A1.2 Trypan Blue exclusion assay</title><p>For the Trypan blue exclusion test, cells were treated and cultured as described.

Dicoumarol (3-3'-methylene-bis (4-hydroxycou-marin) is a commonly used inhibitor of NQO1, which competes with NADH or NADPH for binding to the oxidized form of NQO1. Dicoumarol thereby prevents reduction and activation of various target quinines like &#x003b2;-lapachone.
