<article-title>Tracking Orangutans from the Sky</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Great apes are threatened with extinction, but precise information about the distribution and size of most populations is currently lacking. We conducted orangutan nest counts in the Malaysian state of Sabah (North Borneo), using a combination of ground and helicopter surveys, and provided a way to estimate the current distribution and size of the populations living throughout the entire state. We show that the number of nests detected during aerial surveys is directly related to the estimated true animal density and that a helicopter is an efficient tool to provide robust estimates of orangutan numbers. Our results reveal that with a total estimated population size of about 11,000 individuals, Sabah is one of the main strongholds for orangutans in North Borneo. More than 60% of orangutans living in the state occur outside protected areas, in production forests that have been through several rounds of logging extraction and are still exploited for timber. The role of exploited forests clearly merits further investigation for orangutan conservation in Sabah.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A new aerial method for surveying orangutan densities provides robust estimates of their number and could be used for large- scale surveying of great ape populations in Asia and Africa</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The two orangutan species, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pongo abelii</named-content> in Sumatra and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pongo pygmaeus</named-content> in Borneo, are threatened with extinction in the near future [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A prerequisite for conserving great apes in their natural habitat is good knowledge of population distribution, density, and size. However, precise information is still lacking for many orangutan populations living in Borneo, hindering the design of wise strategies for their long-term conservation [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Densities of orangutans and other great apes are usually estimated from nest censuses along ground line transects [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In order to obtain final estimates of great ape population sizes, these densities are extrapolated to large forest blocks identified from maps as being &#x0201c;suitable habitat&#x0201d; for apes. In most surveys, however, the size of the area actually sampled is very small, and the estimates may not be representative of the population status and/or the variety of habitats and human disturbances (such as logging or mining) existing in the entire range of the population [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, recent land-use changes (such as poaching), and ecological catastrophes (such as those caused by El Ni&#x000f1;o) or disease outbreaks do not appear in published maps [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The latest estimates available for orangutan populations in the Malaysian state of Sabah (North Borneo) range from 20,000 [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to less than 2,000 orangutans [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recent land transformation renders these estimates out-of-date [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and in order to gain precise, up-to-date information, we developed an aerial methodology to assess the entire range of the species in the state precisely. Although some preliminary work using orangutan nest counting from a helicopter was conducted in the past in Sabah and Sarawak [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], this is the first time that aerial surveys have been used to determine population estimates for a great ape species at a state level. This methodology is likely to be useful for documenting the status of great ape populations living in fragmented and exploited forests in Asia and possibly in some parts of Africa.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Correlation between Ground and Aerial Nest Densities</title><p>Ground densities estimated with Distance 3.5 and aerial densities predicted with our model are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030003-t001">Table 1</xref>.

In Sabah, we report that helicopters can also be used for a forest-dwelling species for (1) directly assessing orangutan distribution, and (2) estimating orangutan population size if aerial surveys are conducted in conjunction with a precalibrating stage based on ground-nest surveys. Aerial nest counts increase the size of the sampling areas significantly, provide a way to survey remote areas that are not accessible from the ground, are faster, and require a lower human investment than classical ground censuses.</p><p>Nest detectability from the helicopter depends on observers and canopy structure. Ideally, specific models for deriving nest densities from aerial indexes (number of nests detected per kilometer of flight) should be designed for different human observation skills and for different habitat types. However, observer bias can be avoided if the same team of skilled people conducts the entire survey. The second source of bias could be overcome with the design of several habitat-specific models. Before these types of models are designed, ground-truthing must be conducted in different habitat types in order to validate a baseline model and to determine habitat-specific correction factors when necessary.</p><p>Nest parameters used for obtaining the final orangutan density estimates (nest decay rate, daily rate of nest construction) are a major source of inaccuracy in aerial and ground nest surveys [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and there is a need to investigate interpopulation differences in nest life-span estimates further to produce more precise estimates of orangutan densities [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Our survey shows that there are currently about 11,000 orangutans present in Sabah, making the state the main stronghold for the <italic>P. p. morio</italic> subspecies [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, this represents a minimum 35% decline over the past 20 years [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This decline is mainly due to habitat loss resulting from the recent conversion of extensive tracts of lowland forests to agriculture [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The current network of protected areas in Sabah harbors about 4,000 orangutans, representing about 40% of the total number found in the state. About 60% of the total number of orangutans survives in commercial forest reserves subjected to timber extraction, and these forests harbor the largest unfragmented population of the subspecies <italic>P. p. morio</italic> found in Borneo (population 16).</p><p>The impacts of forest exploitation on ape abundance and ecology depend on several factors, such as (1) the forest types that existed initially and the quality of the regrowth forest [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], (2) type of habitat exploitation [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], (3) hunting pressure [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and (4) species ecology [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Our results tend to indicate that the mosaic of habitats found in the semi-inundated mixed dipterocarp forests that were originally occurring in the floodplains of east Sabah could potentially still harbor a significant number of animals following high disturbance levels (populations 12, 13, and 14). However, we can assume that the very high orangutan densities documented in some of the areas located close to oil palm plantations partly result from the influx of newcomers following recent land conversion to agriculture [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We can also assume that the response of the forests to logging will directly impact the susceptibility of orangutans to habitat exploitation [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Less diverse habitats (dry lowland dipterocarp forests) located in the interior of the state appear to maintain fewer orangutans, particularly following conventional, nonsustainable logging practices (populations 15 and 16). In the extensive tracts of dry lowland dipterocarp forests exploited for timber (populations 15 and 16), our data suggest that, when hunting pressure is low, orangutan abundance is directly related to the degree of logging and associated damage. For these two populations, the highest orangutan densities were identified in Deramakot, a commercial forest reserve (part of population 15) implementing sustainable logging practices [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], suggesting that more conventional, uncontrolled logging activities have a negative impact on orangutan abundance.</p><p>Possible inter- and intraspecific differences in general ecology and feeding behavior of orangutans may also influence population responses to habitat disturbances [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and the results documented in Sabah for <italic>P.p. morio</italic> are not necessarily valid for other Bornean orangutan subspecies and for the Sumatran species [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>All great ape species require large forest areas to survive. An ecological network combining protected areas with seminatural landscape elements and production forests could be seen as an option to conserve biodiversity, while also providing opportunities for the sustainable use of natural resources [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

For each block, we determined a systematic stratified sampling using equidistant parallel line transects, the location of the first line being randomly selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030003-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Because the specific topographical features (steep slopes and high altitudes) encountered over Crocker Range and Kinabalu National Parks prevented the helicopter from following a random pattern of transects, the location of our aerial lines followed valleys in these two blocks. Aerial censuses were carried out with a small-type Bell 206 Jet ranger helicopter. Helicopter speed and height were kept constant at about 70 km/h and 60&#x02013;80 m above the forest canopy. The copilot recorded the precise flight path location with a Global Positioning System every 30 s and monitored altitude, forest type (semi-inundated vs dry), signs of human activities, and forest disturbance continuously. Four types of disturbances were distinguished during aerial surveys: (1) no disturbance: tall and large trees; rather closed canopy; no sign of human exploitation; (2) old exploited forests (timber extraction was conducted more than 15 y prior to the survey): logging roads and stamping areas colonized by pioneer tree species such as <italic>Macaranga</italic> sp. (crown shape and color easily distinguishable from other tree species), some emergent trees; (3) recently exploited forests (timber extraction was conducted less than 15 y ago): logging roads not entirely colonized by pioneer tree species; few emergent trees; (4): active exploitation: logging activities were ongoing at the time of the survey.</p><p>From the back seats, two observers looked for orangutan nests from either side of the helicopter. All visible nests were recorded. It was impossible to estimate the impact of nest age on nest detection, and the observers acknowledged that a few days-old fresh nests (still green in color) and nests at their latest stages of decay (just a few branches visible) were difficult to detect in the canopy. These nest categories are likely to have been underdetected. The two observers indicated all sightings to a nest recorder seated between them. The nest recorder noted the number of nests detected by the observers per each 30-s period. All crew members were in constant radio contact during the flights. After the flight, data collected by the copilot and the nest recorder were matched in order to determine the location of all sightings along the aerial line transect precisely. The same team of observers conducted all aerial surveys in order to avoid the observer bias.</p><p>For technical reasons, it was impossible to fit external devices to the helicopter to estimate the distance of the nests to the aerial transects. This prevented us from determining the detection function from our data alone [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Trailing tapes placed on the aircraft window limited the observers' field of view to a strip of approximately 150 m wide on either side of the aircraft. However, fluctuations in canopy's height prevented the direct determination of the exact width of the sampling area.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Ground censuses.</title><p>Because the proportion of the actual nest population existing in the forest that was detected from the helicopter was unknown, it was impossible to directly estimate nest densities from our aerial results [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We thus designed a calibration function relating nest density estimated from the ground to the number of nests detected per kilometer of flight (aerial nest index) by comparing the aerial results with results from extensive ground surveys carried out in 13 patches of old and recently disturbed forests located in the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and Deramakot, Kalumpang, and Segaliud forest reserves.</p><p>Nest densities and their variances were estimated by ground line transects using distance sampling [<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030003-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
