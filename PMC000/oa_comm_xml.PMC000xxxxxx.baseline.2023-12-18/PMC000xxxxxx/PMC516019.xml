These PAHs elicit cell type-specific effects that help predict toxicity outcomes <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. While BaP and ANTH selectively injure glomerular mesangial cells, and CHRY targets cortico-tubular epithelial cells, binary or ternary mixtures of these hydrocarbons markedly reduce the overall cytotoxic potential of individual hydrocarbons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To study the biochemical basis of these antagonistic interactions, renal glomerular mesangial cells were challenged with BaP alone (0.03 &#x02013; 30 &#x003bc;M) or in the presence of ANTH (3 &#x003bc;M) or CHRY (3 &#x003bc;M) for 24 hr. Total RNA and protein will be harvested for Northern analysis and measurements of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, respectively, to evaluate cytochrome P450 mRNA and protein inducibility. Cellular hydrocarbon uptake and metabolic profiles of PAHs were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Combined hydrocarbon treatments did not influence the cellular uptake of individual hydrocarbons. ANTH or CHRY strongly repressed BaP-inducible cytochrome P450 mRNA and protein expression, and markedly inhibited oxidative BaP metabolism.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings indicate that antagonistic interactions among nephrocarcinogenic PAHs involve altered expression of cytochrome P450s that modulate bioactivation profiles and nephrotoxic/ nephrocarcinogenic potential.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The biological effects of PAHs are often mediated by oxidative metabolism of the parent hydrocarbon to reactive intermediates that adduct DNA and induce oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the kidney, PAHs elicit cell type-specific effects that differentially influence glomerular versus tubular epithelial cell structure and function. BaP and ANTH selectively injure glomerular mesangial cells, while CHRY preferentially targets cortico-tubular epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The study of single chemical effects has provided fundamental information on the nephrotoxic potential of specific PAHs, but human exposure to these group of chemicals is rarely limited to a single agent, and most often involves exposure to PAH mixtures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, a more realistic approach is to evaluate the cellular, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms by which PAHs interact to produce additive, synergistic or antagonistic interactions. Such studies have demonstrated that binary and ternary mixtures of PAHs yield paradoxical antagonistic interactions <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>A toxicological interaction is a circumstance in which exposure to two or more chemicals results in qualitative or quantitative modulation of the biological response elicited by individual agents. Toxicological interactions may be mediated by changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of one or more of the chemicals present in the mixture. Since the ability of PAHs to compromise cellular and genomic integrity often requires bioactivation by cytochrome P-450 enzymes (<italic>CYPs</italic>) to reactive intermediates, their role in PAH-induced environmental diseases is profound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The interaction of PAHs with <italic>CYPs </italic>is unique in that the expression of genes that encode for <italic>CYP</italic>-associated activities is itself regulated by the PAH substrates they metabolize. Shimada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] have shown that BaP and CHRY induce <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>1b1 </italic>through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), and that the enzymes encoded by these genes mediate toxicity and tumorigenicity. The Ahr belongs to the basic helix loop helix/PAS family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The activation of cytoplasmic complexes containing the Ahr depends on ligand binding to the receptor, nuclear translocation and formation of active heterodimers with a nuclear protein called Arnt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The AhR-Arnt complex binds to s pecific <italic>cis</italic>-acting responsive elements known as xenobiotic responsive elements located in the promoters and enhancers of target genes, including <italic>CYPs </italic>themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. PAHs or halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons function as ligands of the Ahr.</p><p>The present studies were conducted to evaluate profiles of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>inducibility in binary PAH mixtures, and their impact on BaP bioactivation. Evidence is presented that chemical-specific differences in the regulation of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>contribute to differential metabolic activation of PAHs in binary mixture. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that interactions between BaP, ANTH and CHRY involve altered expression of cytochrome P450s that modulate bioactivation profiles and nephrotoxic/ nephrocarcinogenic potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>BaP, ANTH and CHRY were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

At least three replicates were used for each chemical concentration tested in multiple experiments. The concentrations examined are similar to those used in previous studies and representative of those encountered in the environment. Cultures were challenged with selected PAHs for 24 hr at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 30 &#x003bc;M. Stock solutions of PAHs were dissolved in DMSO with final DMSO concentrations never exceeding 0.1%. Cells, RNA, or protein were harvested after chemical challenge and processed for biochemical measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using Tri reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to manufacturer's specifications. Cells were scraped using 1.0 ml of Tri reagent and allowed to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes to dissociate nucleoprotein complexes and then combined with 0.2 ml chloroform, vortexed and allowed to sit at room temperature for 2 minutes. After centrifugation at 12,000 &#x000d7; g (4&#x000b0;C) for 15 minutes, the upper aqueous layer was mixed with and equal volume of isopropanol and stored at -20&#x000b0;C overnight. This solution was then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 12,000 &#x000d7; g (4&#x000b0;C) and the pellet washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 20 &#x003bc;l of RNase free water.

Total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde denaturing gel (1.2% agarose, 1 M formaldehyde and 10X MOPS) in 1X MOPS buffer and transferred onto a nylon membrane by capillary transfer. Membranes were dried at room temperature, UV crosslinked and hybridized with 32P labeled cDNA probes synthesized using High Prime (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). The &#x003b2;-tubulin probe was obtained from a 1.6 Kb fragment cloned into a pBluescript plasmid at the EcorI site. The <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>probe was obtained from a 1.2 kb Pst1 fragment from a pUC18 vector (ATCC) and the 1 kb <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>probe was kindly provided by Dr. Colin Jefcoate (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI).

The supernatants were removed and the pellet resuspended in 300 &#x003bc;L of Tris-sucrose buffer. Two 100 &#x003bc;l aliquots containing cellular protein were processed for fluorometric enzyme analysis, while 50 &#x003bc;L of sample was used to measure protein concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) assay</title><p>Cultures were processed for measurements of AHH activity as described by Nebert and Gelboin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A 100 &#x003bc;l aliquot was combined with 1 ml of reaction mixture containing 0.1 M HEPES (pH 8.0) and 0.4 mM NADPH. Samples were pre-incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, and the reaction initiated by addition of 80 &#x003bc;M BaP dissolved in 40 &#x003bc;M of methanol. Samples were incubated for 15 minutes and the reaction terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice cold acetone and 3.25 ml of hexane. After vortexing, 2 ml of the organic layer was collected and extracted with 5 ml of 1 N NaOH. Samples were vortexed and the NaOH fraction read on a spectroflurometer at a wavelength of 396 nm excitation and 522 nm emissions. The spectroflurometer was calibrated using authentic 3-OH BaP standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity</title><p>Cultures were processed for measurements of EROD activity as described by Burke and Mayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] with modifications.

The tubes were incubated for 2 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C prior to addition of 100 mM ethoxyresorufin. 50 ml of ethoxyresorufin was added to each tube and allowed to incubate at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2.5 ml of methanol. Samples were incubated for an additional 2 minutes to allow for protein flocculation and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 &#x000d7; g. EROD activity in the supernatant was measured fluorometrically at a wavelength of 550 nm excitation and 585 nm emission as described by pohl and Fouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

To test this hypothesis, steady state levels of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>mRNAs were evaluated by Northern analysis in cultured mesangial cells treated with 0.03 &#x02013; 30 &#x003bc;M BaP alone, or in combination with 3 &#x003bc;M ANTH and CHRY (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>mRNA was not expressed constitutively, but was highly inducible by BaP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). ANTH alone (0.03 &#x02013; 30 &#x003bc;M) did not induce <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>at any concentration, but modestly enhanced (3 &#x003bc;M) the mesangial cell response to BaP (3 or 30 &#x003bc;M). In contrast to the <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>gene, <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>was constitutively expressed in mesangial cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

As expected, BaP induced <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>mRNA levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels A and B). CHRY was also a potent <italic>Cyp </italic>inducer, and in fact elicited greater induction of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>mRNA than BaP (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels A and B). CHRY induction of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>at the 3 and 30 &#x003bc;M concentrations was 2-fold higher than the response elicited by BaP at the same concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As with <italic>Cyp1a1</italic>, CHRY markedly induced <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>steady state mRNA levels at all concentrations examined (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Combined treatment of mesangial cells with BaP (0.03 &#x02013; 30 &#x003bc;M) and CHRY (3 &#x003bc;M) yielded modest antagonistic responses for both <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1</italic>, particularly at the highest concentrations examined. For <italic>Cyp1b1</italic>, the induction response in cells treated with 30 &#x003bc;M BaP and 3 &#x003bc;M CHRY was reduced by 30% relative to either hydrocarbon alone.</p></sec><sec><title>CYP enzymatic activities in renal cells after challenge with PAH mixtures</title><p>Because mRNA expression does not always correlate with changes in protein levels, measurements of EROD and AHH activity were completed in mesangial cells treated with PAHs alone, or in binary mixture. EROD, an enzyme activity encoded by both <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1</italic>, was inducible by all hydrocarbons in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Basal and inducible EROD activities in mesangial cells were considerably lower than those in cultured rat hepatocytes (not shown). A greater than 6-fold enhancement of EROD activity was observed in cells treated with 0.3 &#x003bc;M of BaP, with significant decreases observed as the BaP concentration increased. ANTH and CHRY also induced EROD, but induction patterns for these hydrocarbons were remarkably different. ANTH was a weak inducer of EROD, with only a 3-fold induction observed at 30 &#x003bc;M, while CHRY elicited a greater than 14-fold increase in enzymatic activity. As with BaP, reductions in activity were observed at the highest CHRY concentrations. Different profiles were observed in cells treated with BaP in combination with either ANTH or CHRY. Combined treatment of mesangial cells with BaP and ANTH completely inhibited EROD inducibility. In the case of CHRY, co-treatment with BaP yielded an erratic response, with less than additive interactions observed at the lowest concentrations, and modest inhibition observed as hydrocarbon concentrations increased.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>EROD activity in rGMCs treated with PAHs. </bold>EROD activity in rGMCs challenged with BaP, ANTH and CHRY alone or the binary mixtures of BaP with ANTH or CHRY.

A greater than 40-fold induction in enzymatic activity was observed at 30 &#x003bc;M BaP (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Individual treatment with ANTH or CHRY did not modulate AHH activity. Combined treatment of mesangial cells with BaP and ANTH repressed AHH activity at the lower BaP concentrations, but the negative interaction was dissipated at higher concentrations.

At least 50% of the parent compound was reproducibly detected in mesangial cells treated with BaP (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). ANTH was readily taken up by mesangial cells, and did not influence the cellular uptake of BaP. 3-hydroxy-BaP was the primary oxidative metabolite detected in mesangial cells treated with BaP, with other metabolites representing less than 1% of the total metabolite pool detected (not shown). Combined treatment of cells with ANTH significantly reduced BaP metabolism, with greater than 80% reduction in detectable metabolite levels (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1A</xref>). Mesangial cells readily took up CHRY, with greater than 77% of the parent compound detected at the end of the treatment. As with ANTH, CHRY did not influence the cellular uptake of BaP.

To study the complexity of chemico-biological interactions following exposures to multiple PAH carcinogens, we evaluated the renal cell-specific response to binary and ternary mixtures of BaP, ANTH and CHRY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Challenge of renal mesangial and cortico-tubular epithelial cells with BaP in combination with ANTH or CHRY yielded unexpected antagonistic interactions that may be partly explained by differential regulation of enzymes involved in PAH metabolism. Renal <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>are particularly relevant since these enzymes mediate the conversion of PAHs to intermediates that induce oxidative stress and bind covalently to DNA in the kidney, and are the primary enzymes responsible for bioactivation of carcinogenic PAHs in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In mesangial cells,<italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>mRNA was undetectable under constitutive conditions, highly inducible by BaP and CHRY, and refractory to ANTH (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>mRNA was constitutively expressed and highly inducible by all three hydrocarbons. BaP and CHRY were more potent inducers of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>than ANTH (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), a profile consistent with their relative abilities to activate Ahr signaling in mammalian cells (15). Shimada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have shown that liver and lung <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>mRNAs are highly induced in AhR(+/+) mice by a single intraperitoneal injection of carcinogenic PAHs, and that 6-aminochrysene, chrysene, benzo [e]pyrene, and 1-nitropyrene weakly induced <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>mRNAs, while non-carcinogenic hydrocarbons, such as anthracene, pyrene, and fluoranthene, were poor or inactive enzyme inducers. These findings indicate that the toxicity and carcinogenicity profiles of PAHs may be defined on the basis of their ability to regulate <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>at either the mRNA or protein level.</p><p>The tissue-specific induction of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>mRNAs by PAHs and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been investigated in wildtype and AhR-deficient C57BL/6J mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. While expression of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>is AhR-dependent, <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>is constitutively expressed in various organs in male and female Ahr (+/+) and Ahr (-/-) mice. <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>is of interest because it encodes for AHH and EROD, the predominant PAH-metabolizing activities in rodent embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Important roles of <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>in PAH carcinogenesis have been proposed by Gonzalez and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] who observed that <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>knock-out mice expressing significant levels of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>are highly resistant to lymphoma formation by 7,12-DMBA. <italic>In vitro </italic>human studies with recombinant enzymes have shown that <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>is more active (about 10-fold) than <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>in the formation of BaP-7,8-diol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>CYP enzymatic activities and toxicological interactions</title><p>Measurements of EROD and AHH were used to monitor kidney microsomal catalytic activities (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The profile of enzyme induction was significantly different between BaP, ANTH and CHRY. The basal activities of EROD and AHH were very low in control cultures, but highly inducible in response to BaP and CHRY. BaP was considerably more potent than ANTH as an inducer of EROD and AHH, while CHRY only induced EROD activity. Interestingly, CHRY was a better inducer of <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>mRNA, but induction at the mRNA level was not associated with corresponding increases of enzymatic activity. The greater potency of BaP as an inducer of enzymatic activities compared to ANTH and CHRY is consistent with previous observations showing that BaP is the most toxic PAH to renal mesangial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The profiles of mRNA and protein induction elicited by single exposures to BaP, ANTH, and CHRY alone were markedly different from those following challenge in binary mixture. ANTH enhanced both <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>inducibility by BaP, but EROD and AHH activities were reduced in binary mixture. CHRY, on the other hand, modestly inhibited <italic>Cyp1a1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>mRNA inducibility by BaP and also reduced AHH activity. Because both ANTH and CHRY antagonize the mesangial cell response to BaP (3), these findings implicate AHH as the primary enzymatic target for antagonistic interactions among nephrotoxic PAHs.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxidative metabolic profiles and toxicological interactions</title><p>The above interpretation is supported by the marked inhibition of 3-OH BaP formation seen in cells co-treated with BaP and ANTH or CHRY (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). A role for EROD in mesangial cell injury cannot be ruled out, however, since ANTH selectively antagonized EROD activity and inhibited hydrocarbon metabolism. Thus, patterns of Cyp inducibility and oxidative metabolism may account for differences in the responses to BaP, ANTH and CHRY in kidney cells, and their interactions in simple and complex mixtures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A major implication of our findings is that despite similarities in gene and protein inducibility among structurally-related PAHs, their behavior may be influenced by the reactivity of oxidative intermediates generated during the course of cellular metabolism. As such, PAH substrates in complex mixtures may compete for, and inhibit, the same metabolizing enzymes that act upon them to give rise to antagonistic interactions that protect against further chemical toxicity. Interactions of this nature are among the most commonly encountered in environmental mixtures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but the magnitude and capacity of these interactions for most relevant environmental nephrocarcinogens is unknown.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Colin Jefcoate (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) for providing <italic>Cyp1b1 </italic>probe and Dr. Lingyu He for assistance with HPLC analysis.
