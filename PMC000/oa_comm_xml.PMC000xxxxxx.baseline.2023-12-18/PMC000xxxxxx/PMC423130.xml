<article-title>Ecology Drives the Global Distribution of Human Diseases</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Identifying the factors underlying the origin and maintenance of the latitudinal diversity gradient is a central problem in ecology, but no consensus has emerged on which processes might generate this broad pattern. Interestingly, the vast majority of studies exploring the gradient have focused on free-living organisms, ignoring parasitic and infectious disease (PID) species. Here, we address the influence of environmental factors on the biological diversity of human pathogens and their global spatial organization. Using generalized linear multivariate models and Monte Carlo simulations, we conducted a series of comparative analyses to test the hypothesis that human PIDs exhibit the same global patterns of distribution as other taxonomic groups. We found a significant negative relationship between latitude and PID species richness, and a nested spatial organization, i.e., the accumulation of PID species with latitude, over large spatial scales. Additionally, our results show that climatic factors are of primary importance in explaining the link between latitude and the spatial pattern of human pathogens. Based on our findings, we propose that the global latitudinal species diversity gradient might be generated in large part by biotic interactions, providing strong support for the idea that current estimates of species diversity are substantially underestimated. When parasites and pathogens are included, estimates of total species diversity may increase by more than an order of magnitude.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Comparative analyses reveal that human pathogens increase towards the equator and that the relationship is linked to climate - this has important implications for global biodiversity, public health and environmental epidemiology</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Generally, the number of plant and animal species declines as one moves away from the equator (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Pianka1" ref-type="bibr">Pianka 1966</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">Stevens 1989</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Stevens2" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Rohde1" ref-type="bibr">Rohde 1992</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">Brown 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">Kaufman 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Rosenzweig1" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Huston1" ref-type="bibr">Huston 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Chown1" ref-type="bibr">Chown and Gaston 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins and Porter 2001</xref>).

Over 30 hypotheses have been proposed to explain it (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Rohde1" ref-type="bibr">Rohde 1992</xref>), and it is only over the past several years that the most credible candidates have been identified; these are hypotheses related to area, energy, and time (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Gaston1" ref-type="bibr">Gaston and Blackburn 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Rahbek1" ref-type="bibr">Rahbek and Graves 2001</xref>) and to habitat heterogeneity and geometric constraints (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Rahbek1" ref-type="bibr">Rahbek and Graves 2001</xref>).</p><p>The vast majority of studies exploring the latitudinal species diversity gradient have focused on free-living organisms, such as herbivores, mammals, and angiosperms, and with rare exception (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Hillebrand1" ref-type="bibr">Hillebrand et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Curtis1" ref-type="bibr">Curtis et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Nee1" ref-type="bibr">Nee 2003</xref>), none has examined large-scale latitudinal species diversity patterns of pathogenic microorganisms. Biotic interactions such as parasitism, predation, and symbiosis have been often invoked as a causal mechanism for the gradient (see <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Rohde1" ref-type="bibr">Rohde 1992</xref>), but no serious attempts have been made to quantify its importance to biodiversity. Parasitic and infectious diseases (PIDs), in particular, could prove to be key in understanding large-scale patterns of species diversity on Earth since they comprise a major part of total biological diversity (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Combes1" ref-type="bibr">Combes 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Poulin1" ref-type="bibr">Poulin 1998</xref>). Moreover, our understanding of human diseases and the existence of complete data sets provide an incomparable opportunity to explore the existence of a relationship between PID species richness and latitude, and to identify the determining factors of this latitudinal gradient.</p><p>In recent years, research into nonrandom organization in parasite communities has turned, e.g., to the possible existence of nestedness. Nested structure is a hierarchical organization of species composition in which assemblages with successively lower species richness tend to be nonrandom subsets of richer assemblages (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Hanski1" ref-type="bibr">Hanski 1982</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Atmar 1986</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Patterson2" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Brown 1991</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Poulin2" ref-type="bibr">Poulin and Gu&#x000e9;gan 2000</xref>). Some species are widely distributed and occur in many communities, whereas other species have more restricted distributions and occur only in a subset of the richest samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020141-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

In the present study we seek an answer to the following question: To what extent is the global distribution of human pathogens specified by the properties of the physical environment or the organism itself, and to what extent does it depend on chance events?</p><fig id="pbio-0020141-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Spatial Organization of Species</title><p>Letters represent different PID species.

This similarity in the patterns of PID species and free-living organisms suggests that common mechanisms are at work. Regardless of whether PID richness simply tracks host diversity or, rather, is determined to a greater extent by exogenous factors, our analyses indicate that the most likely explanation for these patterns is the climatically-based energy hypothesis, i.e., that energy availability generates and maintains species richness gradients (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Rohde1" ref-type="bibr">Rohde 1992</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Gaston1" ref-type="bibr">Gaston and Blackburn 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Hawkins2" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et al. 2003</xref>). Many studies have identified correlations between gradients in species diversity and variation in climate (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al. 1999</xref>). Climate, in turn, largely determines the species of plants and animals that live in those areas. According to our results&#x02014;and in contrast to the results of <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">Allen and colleagues (2002)</xref>, who showed that environmental temperature was the best predictor of species diversity for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ectotherm taxa&#x02014;the maximum range of precipitation is highly correlated with the latitudinal gradient of pathogen species, with diversity significantly increasing with this climate-based factor. Interestingly, the annual variation of precipitation around the mean (and not the mean itself) was the best predictor overall of pathogen species distribution. This suggests that pathogen species, their vectors, or their hosts tend to be adapted to regions having more contrasted wetness and dryness conditions through the year (i.e., in tropical regions). Many parasites obviously require water or humid conditions to complete their life cycle, e.g., vector-borne diseases. So, the physical factor of precipitation variation may affect parasitic and infectious microorganism diversity, if the biological cyclicity of a variety of parasitic and infectious stages have adapted to the variability of precipitation. This might be why &#x0201c;latitude&#x0201d; does not appear in the minimal generalized linear models (GLIMs) for explaining the richnesses of bacteria, directly transmitted viruses, and fungi, these taxa being &#x0201c;internal&#x0201d; to the host, so less directly affected by environmental variability. Moreover, these taxa may more readily spread over longer distances via their hosts, and this should minimize the impact of environmental conditions. In contrast, taxa with &#x0201c;external&#x0201d; stages, like helminths or vector-transmitted pathogens, are more influenced by their environment. Nevertheless, other causes might explain why certain taxa do not conform to the general pattern, notably (1) the absence of possible explanatory variables in the GLIMs, (2) missing or imprecise information due to the large scale of our study, or (3) the real absence of correlations between the spatial distributions of certain taxonomic groups and the variables considered here.</p><p>All three nestedness models (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) explained some of the variation in pathogen species across latitudes. Distance and isolation from pathogen species&#x02013;rich regions in the tropics may sort PID species by their extinction&#x02013;colonization dynamics (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Lomolino1" ref-type="bibr">Lomolino 1996</xref>). In addition, the availability of new hosts and reservoirs, passive sampling, and probabilistic filters screening species with particular characteristics (local habitat suitabilities, differential colonization capacities of species, and sustainability of viable populations within their environment) may further limit PID species (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al. 1998</xref>) and thus strongly affect the spatial organization of PID species. Nestedness might in fact be an inevitable second-order consequence of the same factors that cause variation in species richness and range size (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Gaston1" ref-type="bibr">Gaston and Blackburn 2000</xref>).</p><p>In addition, our results suggest that total species diversity on the planet might be substantially underestimated, especially because inventories generally focus attention on the most charismatic groups (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Shaw1" ref-type="bibr">Shaw and Hochberg 2001</xref>), and little is known about the biodiversity of microorganisms associated with each considered group of organisms, i.e., hosts (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Ashford2" ref-type="bibr">Ashford and Crewe 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Ashford1" ref-type="bibr">Ashford 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Nee1" ref-type="bibr">Nee 2003</xref>). Based on a single host species, humans, we estimate that true tropical pathogen species diversity is greater than current estimates by a factor of about 22 in the Northern Hemisphere and about 37 in the Southern Hemisphere. If our work is representative of other (host) species, diversity may be currently underestimated by more than an order of magnitude, and based on our findings, this differential should increase as one goes from temperate to tropical latitudes. Our work quantitatively demonstrates that parasitic and pathogenic organisms, as representatives of biotic interactions, strongly amplify the general latitudinal gradient in species richness. The smallest organisms that have been neglected by science could very well be the biggest in generating the observed diversity pattern.</p><p>The demonstration that parasitic and infectious organisms in humans do not constitute random assemblages at large spatial scales, but rather that many types of microorganisms show a predictable geographical distribution over the planet, could have important implications for public health policies. Our results show that climatic factors are of primary importance in explaining the occurrence and diversity of human pathogens, suggesting that global climate change might have cascading effects regarding the risks of PIDs. For instance, if specific temperate areas were to become more tropical, our results suggest that PID species and their associated vectors/reservoirs would be likely to colonize these changed areas. This would imply a progressive dissolution of the latitudinal effect and of the nested hierarchical structure as observed in the present study as pathogen species became more globally distributed. There is some recent evidence for this hypothesis (see <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Lindgren1" ref-type="bibr">Lindgren and Gustafson 2001</xref>).</p><p>Other variables are indeed important in explaining global-scale patterns of human pathogens (e.g., modernization, urbanization, and pauperization, especially in developing countries). Thus, we do not mean to imply that latitude and surrogate variables are the only ones affecting PID species richness. Nevertheless, our results challenge the conventional wisdom that socio-economic conditions are of preponderant importance in controlling or eradicating diseases. These considerations indicate that a better understanding of PID species diversity and community dynamics in a changing world will be one of the major challenges in environmental epidemiology in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Presence/absence matrix</title><p>We compiled data on PID occurrence for a total of 332 different human pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and helminths distributed across 224 nations. Epidemiological data on PID species were extracted from the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cyinfo.com">http://www.cyinfo.com</ext-link>).The presence/absence matrix for the 229 distinct PIDs (after elimination of 103 unavailable values) across the Northern and Southern hemispheres was organised employing the Nestedness Temperature Calculator (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Atmar1" ref-type="bibr">Atmar and Patterson 1995</xref>). One hundred seven ubiquitous pathogen species were eliminated from the database because the information they contained was entirely redundant with that of the most ubiquitous species already present in the matrix. The matrix of species presence/absence provides distributional information about which species occurs in which countries.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>GLIMs</title><p>We employed GLIMs (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Crawley1" ref-type="bibr">Crawley 1993</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Venables1" ref-type="bibr">Venables and Ripley 1999</xref>) from the S-Plus statistical package (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Venables1" ref-type="bibr">Venables and Ripley 1999</xref>) to identify and characterize the effects of potential independent parameters and their interaction terms on PID species richness, which is the total number of human diseases known within the boundary limits of each country. It has been argued that species richness increases with increasing area sampled (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins and Porter 2001</xref>; but see <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Rohde2" ref-type="bibr">Rohde 1997</xref>). Therefore, we included total surface area per country (in square kilometers) in our analyses, in order to control for its effect in the multivariate analysis. Similarly, we considered human population size and human population density per country (in persons per square kilometer), both highly colinear with surface area, as possible explanatory factors, since the number and density of human hosts may also influence parasite species richness (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and May 1991</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Guegan2" ref-type="bibr">Gu&#x000e9;gan et al. 2001</xref>). In addition, we considered a variety of environmental, demographic, and economical factors. Variables selected as environmental factors for each country were (1) continent, (2) hemisphere, (3) whether the country was insular or continental, (4) percentages of arable land, permanent pastures, permanent crops, irrigated lands, forest woodlands, and &#x0201c;other,&#x0201d; (5) mean latitude coordinate, centered at the country barycenter (in minute degrees), and (6) mean longitude (in minute degrees) from the Greenwich Meridian.</p><p>Variables selected as demographic factors were (1) human population size, (2) human population density (persons per square kilometer), (3) human birth rate (births/1,000 people/year), (4) human death rate (deaths/1,000 people/year), and (5) annual population growth rate (average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country).</p><p>We employed the gross national product (per capita in United States dollars) as the economic factor, which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production. We also selected a few other variables linked to particular landscape practices (percentages of arable land, permanent pastures, permanent crops, irrigated lands, forest woodlands, and &#x0201c;other&#x0201d;), which were supposed to interact with the production of the nation. Data were collected from The World Factbook 2001 on the Internet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook">http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook</ext-link>) and from the appendix of <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">Scott and Duncan (1998)</xref>.</p><p>To relate richness to environmental factors, we employed a GLIM with a Poisson error and a log link function (see <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Grenfell 1997</xref>).

Since close geographical neighbors (i.e., two countries sharing a boundary) probably also share common PID species, simple cross-country comparisons could include spatial autocorrelation artefacts (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Manly1" ref-type="bibr">Manly 1991</xref>). To test whether this influenced our regressions, we employed Monte Carlo simulations to calculate Moran's index <italic>(I)</italic> between the matrix of PID species richness and the matrix of distances across the 224 countries (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Manly1" ref-type="bibr">Manly 1991</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Guegan1" ref-type="bibr">Gu&#x000e9;gan and Hugueny 1994</xref>). The <italic>I</italic> value is bound between &#x02212;1 and +1, with 0 indicating no spatial autocorrelation, and +1/&#x02212;1 indicating a strong positive/negative autocorrelation, respectively. We first computed the correlation coefficient based on all pairs of neighboring countries, and we randomly estimated 99 coefficients each time, permuting the matching countries. The decision rule, ensuring significance at &#x003b1; = 0.01, consisted in rejecting the null hypothesis of the absence of spatial correlation if the correlation coefficient obtained for nonpermuted data was maximum among all 100 coefficients. The calculation of <italic>I</italic> using Monte Carlo simulations indicated no strong spatial autocorrelation (<italic>I</italic>

We used the data matrix of presence/absence values for 229 different pathogen species of the total dataset comprising 224 countries. We assessed the degree of nestedness of the system using two different, but complementary, analysis programs: (1) Nestedness (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Guegan1" ref-type="bibr">Gu&#x000e9;gan and Hugueny 1994</xref>) and (2) Nestedness Temperature Calculator (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Atmar1" ref-type="bibr">Atmar and Patterson 1995</xref>). Nested diversity patterns are identified when species found in depauperate communities represent nonrandom subsets of progressively richer communities (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Gaston1" ref-type="bibr">Gaston and Blackburn 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Poulin2" ref-type="bibr">Poulin and Gu&#x000e9;gan 2000</xref>). In procedure 1, pathogen species were either selected with uniform probability (null model R<sub>0</sub>) or with a probability proportional to their incidence (R<sub>1</sub>) (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Guegan1" ref-type="bibr">Gu&#x000e9;gan and Hugueny 1994</xref>), whereas in procedure 2 we tested the null model R<sub>00</sub> (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Poulin2" ref-type="bibr">Poulin and Gu&#x000e9;gan 2000</xref>; see also <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Cook1" ref-type="bibr">Cook and Quinn 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Gaston1" ref-type="bibr">Gaston and Blackburn 2000</xref>). Nestedness Temperature Calculator generates simulated null matrices without either row or column constraints (hence &#x0201c;00&#x0201d;); only the total number of presences is fixed at the observed value. All three null hypotheses assume that sites are independent of one another (<xref rid="pbio-0020141-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>According to the procedure adopted by the Nestedness Temperature Calculator (see <xref rid="pbio-0020141-Atmar1" ref-type="bibr">Atmar and Patterson 1995</xref>), the matrix is first &#x0201c;packed&#x0201d; into a state of maximum nestedness, reordering rows and columns. By convention, the most species-rich country is placed along the top row, and the most widely distributed species is placed in the leftmost column, so as to concentrate presences in a corner of the matrix, and to minimize unexpected species absences and presences as in theoretical <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020141-g001">Figure 1</xref>A. This will make differences in PID species distribution across countries readily perceivable. Moreover, not all unexpected species presences and absences are of equal informational value, and this must be taken into account. As we move away from the corner, where cells are most likely to be occupied, unexpected absences and presences begin to appear. The occurrence boundary lines (black exponential curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020141-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) are based on the distribution of unexpected species' presences and absences within the matrix. These curves determine the hypothetical boundary between the occupied area of the matrix and the unoccupied area. A color scale indicates the probability of a cell's occupancy. Nestedness Temperature Calculator also includes a Monte Carlo component to assess the statistical assurance that the parent data matrix was not randomly generated. To assess that probability, 1,000 randomized permutations were drawn to determine a baseline expectation. The result is a histogram representing the 1,000 &#x0201c;temperature&#x0201d; values obtained after permutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020141-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). A black arrow indicates the &#x0201c;temperature&#x0201d; value observed with our master matrix. Lastly, the probability of obtaining this value by random is calculated.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank A. T.
