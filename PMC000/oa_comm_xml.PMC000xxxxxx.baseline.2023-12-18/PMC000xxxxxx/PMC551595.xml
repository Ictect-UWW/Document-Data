One of the reasons for the dismal prognosis is the propensity of pancreatic cancer cells to invade surrounding tissues and to metastasize. Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is a small secreted protein normally expressed in cartilage and also produced by malignant melanoma cells and to a lesser degree by breast, colon cancer, and glioblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The exact biological functions of MIA are still unclear, but recent evidence indicates an important role of MIA in tumor progression and metastasis. MIA has been shown to interact with the components of the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin and laminin, possibly via the binding motif for integrins. For example, MIA inhibits the attachment of suspended melanoma cells to surfaces coated with laminin or fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, overexpression of MIA in melanoma cells induces an aggressive tumor type by enhancing the metastatic potential. It has been shown that there is a correlation between increased plasma levels of MIA and a more advanced metastatic disease state in malignant melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Previously, using DNA array technology, we have demonstrated an increase of MIA mRNA expression in pancreatic cancer in comparison with the normal pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the present study, we have further investigated the expression and localization of MIA, and its functional role in pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To quantify the mRNA expression of MIA in pancreatic tissues, QRT-PCR was performed using RNA from pancreatic cancer tissues (n = 23) and normal pancreatic tissue samples (n = 17). The analysis revealed a 42 &#x000b1; 28-fold increase (p = 0.0013) of MIA mRNA levels in pancreatic cancer tissues compared to the normal pancreas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To determine the exact localization of MIA in pancreatic tissues, immunostaining was carried out in 32 primary pancreatic cancers and in 17 normal pancreatic tissue samples. In the normal pancreas, MIA immunoreactivity was absent in ductal, acinar and islets cells, but was observed in the muscular layer of vessels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). In contrast, in pancreatic cancer tissues, MIA immunoreactivity was moderate in the cancer cells and in tubular complexes in CP-like lesions adjacent to the tumor mass (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D&#x02013;F</xref>), and in blood vessels and nerve ganglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H</xref>). Further analysis to correlate different tumor stages and grades with MIA immunoreactivity in pancreatic cancer tissues was performed. No difference between tumor stages, grades and MIA immunostaining was observed. To ensure the specificity of the antibody used, a malignant melanoma metastasis to the peritoneum was also analyzed. Strong cytoplasmic MIA staining of the malignant melanoma cells but not the surrounding tissues could be detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). Since a correlation between increased serum levels of MIA in malignant melanoma and more advanced metastatic disease has been reported previously, we next investigated MIA serum levels in pancreatic cancer patients and healthy donors. The mean values of MIA serum levels were 8.3 &#x000b1; 3.56 ng/ml in pancreatic cancer patients (n = 50) and 8.82 &#x000b1; 2.01 ng/ml in control subjects (n = 14) (n.s.) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Further analysis revealed that there was also no significant difference between patient groups with different tumor stages or grades.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>MIA mRNA expression and serum levels. </bold><bold>A: </bold>MIA mRNA values in normal pancreatic tissues and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (cancer) tissues by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, as described in the <italic>Methods </italic>section.

QRT-PCR analysis revealed relatively high MIA mRNA levels in Mia PaCa-2, Panc-1, and SU8686 pancreatic cancer cells compared to the other cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Immunoblot analysis was employed to evaluate MIA protein levels in pancreatic cancer cell lines. This analysis revealed a band of 15 kDa corresponding to the known size of MIA in the control melanoma cell line B16 (B78/H1), whereas it was only weakly present in Mia Paca-2, Panc-1, and SU8686 pancreatic cancer cell lines, and below the level of detection in the other tested cell lines (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). To confirm the specificity of the signal, immunoprecipitation was performed. This demonstrated an immunospecific band at 15 kDa in B78/H1, Mia PaCa-2, and SU8686 cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Expression and effects of MIA in cultured pancreatic cancer cells. </bold><bold>A: </bold>MIA mRNA levels in indicated pancreatic cancer cell lines were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, as described in the <italic>Methods </italic>section.

The values shown are the mean &#x000b1; SEM obtained from three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2867-5-3-3"/></fig><p>In order to determine the effects of MIA on the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, MTT cell growth assays were performed next. This analysis revealed no significant effects of MIA on the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells (data not shown). To analyze whether MIA may promote invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells, Matrigel-based invasion assays using a modified Boyden chamber were carried out in T3M4 and Aspc-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines that exhibited relatively low MIA expression levels according to QRT-PCR and Western blot data. Added to the top chamber as described in <italic>Methods </italic>section, MIA significantly increased the invasion of Aspc-1 by 2.4-fold (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and the invasion of T3M4 by 3.1-fold (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). To investigate possible mechanisms of MIA overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells, we analyzed whether micro-environmental changes may modulate MIA expression. Neither TGF-&#x003b2;1 nor hypoxia was able to alter MIA mRNA expression, according to the QRT-PCR analysis of correspondingly treated pancreatic cancer cell lines (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>One of the most devastating aspects of malignant growth is the emergence of cancer foci in organs distant from the primary tumor, with most cancer mortality being related to metastases. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the metastatic process is one of the most important issues in cancer research.</p><p>Pancreatic cancer is characterized by aggressive local tumor growth and early systemic tumor spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Many factors are involved in transforming pancreatic cancer into a highly aggressive and metastatic disease, such as alterations in cell-cell interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], deregulated expression of extracellular proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and metastasis-associated genes such as KAI-1, heparanase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and a number of other molecules.</p><p>Another important aspect of the metastasis process is neo-angiogenesis. Angiogenesis itself encompasses a cascade of sequential processes emanating from microvascular endothelial cells, which are stimulated to proliferate, degrade the endothelial basement membranes of parental vessels, migrate, penetrate host stroma, and initiate a capillary sprout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Numerous angiogenic factors are overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bFGF, and angiogenin, as well as members of the TGF-&#x003b2;, and FGF gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In order to migrate and metastasize, cancer cells have to overcome and move through natural barriers created by cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion structures. Any destruction in cell-cell and ECM networks will facilitate motility and allow the cancer cells to migrate and metastasize. The invasion and metastatic potential of cancer cells depends on their intrinsic properties and the host microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) increases cell motility by decreasing the attachment of the cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Overexpression of MIA leads to increased metastasis of malignant melanoma cells by enhancing invasion and extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the present study we show by QRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry that MIA is significantly over-expressed in pancreatic cancer in comparison with normal pancreatic tissues. These data are in agreement with findings in malignant melanoma and breast cancer, in which MIA is also highly expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to observations in malignant melanoma, where MIA has been established as a reliable marker for prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we could not detect either a significant difference of MIA serum levels between pancreatic cancer patients and donors or a significant difference between patients at different stages of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, MIA cannot serve as a diagnostic or prognostic marker in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The reason why high MIA mRNA levels lead to high serum levels in malignant melanoma, but not in pancreatic cancer, is currently not known. As to the possible role of MIA in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis, MIA had no effect on the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, similar to previous experiments employing fibroblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells and lymphocytes. The only cellular system in which MIA has been found to influence cell growth is melanoma cells; in these cells, MIA exerts anti-proliferative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Although MIA did not affect the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, its impact on the invasion was striking. Interestingly, promotion of invasiveness of pancreatic cancer contrasts the previously demonstrated decrease in the invasion of MIA-treated malignant melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A possible explanation for this dissimilarity might be that MIA has no effect in detachment of pancreatic cancer cells from the ECM, like in malignant melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Alternatively, the status of MIA-interacting partners or downstream targets in the MIA signaling pathway may differ between pancreatic and melanoma cancer cells. So far, a possible correlation between MIA and other proteins known to be involved in pancreatic cancer metastasis &#x02013; such as extracellular proteases, MMP, VEGF and bFGF &#x02013; has not been studied. Therefore, the mechanism responsible for the invasion-promoting action of MIA requires further evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study shows a striking overexpression of MIA in cancerous pancreatic tissues without consequent elevation of MIA in the circulation. Involvement of MIA in regulation of invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells indicates that this protein may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the search for anti-metastatic drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and tissues</title><p>Pancreatic cancer tissue samples were collected from 55 patients who underwent pancreatic cancer resection in the Department of General Surgery at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, and in the Department of Visceral and Transplantation Surgery at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Twelve cases were stage I, 13 cases stage II, 23 cases stage III, and 7 cases stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinomas, according to the Union International Contre Le Cancer (UICC) system. According to routine pathological grading, 16 cases were well-differentiated, 22 moderately differentiated, and 17 poorly differentiated. Normal pancreatic tissues were collected from 34 healthy organ donors. Pancreatic tissues were either frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C (for RNA and protein extraction) or immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and subsequently embedded in paraffin. In order to determine MIA serum concentrations, sera from 50 pancreatic cancer patients (35 male, 15 female; median age 59 years; range 29&#x02013;80 years) and healthy volunteers (14 male; median age 27 years; range 25&#x02013;35 years) were collected at the Department of General Surgery, University of Heidelberg, Germany.
