Understanding this versatile genus will be key to its control</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In July 2000, the finger of blame for a mysterious mass killer of Californian oak trees came to rest on a previously undescribed plant pathogen. From the initial identification of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora ramorum</named-content>, it took less than four years to produce a draft sequence of its genome, one of the fastest-ever discovery-to-sequence stories for a complex pathogen. This achievement was a United States initiative, facilitated by the injection of federal and state funding into <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> research. But the US is not alone in the battle against this genus. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> species cause thousands of millions of dollars of damage to the world's commercial crops every year: they blight potatoes and tomatoes, devastate the lucrative soybean, and rot cacao, threatening the world's supply of chocolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020213-g001">Figure 1</xref>). But for Sophien Kamoun, Associate Professor of Plant Pathology at Ohio State University (Wooster, Ohio, United States), these destructive organisms present an exciting opportunity. There are some 60 species of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content>, but so little is known about the genus, he says, that there are things about its species we didn't even know we didn't know. &#x02018;What I find really exciting,&#x02019; he says, &#x02018;is discovering these unknown unknowns.&#x02019;</p><fig id="pbio-0020213-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>

Saunders and the USDA Agricultural Research Service [B].)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020213.g001"/></fig><p>The most infamous of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> pathogens is the potato late blight, <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content>. It was this species that led to the Irish potato famine in the mid-1840s, which resulted in the death or displacement of millions. Today, <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> is estimated to cost potato and tomato farmers US$5,000,000,000 a year in lost revenue. The story for the soybean pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. sojae</named-content> is similar, causing loss of more than US$1,000,000,000 a year to soybean growers. In addition to the direct economic impact of these pathogens, introduced <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> can cause severe damage to native flora. The most recent <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> on the scene is <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>, which has caused &#x02018;sudden oak death&#x02019; (SOD) in tens of thousands of oak trees across the coastal counties of California, is now present in at least three other US states and is threatening to take on the native flora of the entire North American continent. It is also lurking in Europe, although apparently with less devastating consequences.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Molecular Machinery</title><p>With this kind of impact, it's no surprise that money has poured into research on <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content>. This year, the US federal government will channel US$7,400,000 toward research into SOD. A major focus of this funding is genomics. Sequencing the genomes of several <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> will help clarify the phylogeny and evolution of these enigmatic organisms (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>) and improve methods of detection and identification. Ultimately, however, sequencing should reveal the molecular tricks that this genus uses to subvert the defences of its plant hosts, allowing scientists to come up with new ways to combat these troublesome organisms.</p><p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> sequencing initiative, coordinated by Kamoun, has recently completed a survey sequence of the genome that gives an initial understanding of how this organism is structured. Perhaps most striking is its size. &#x02018;It's a huge genome,&#x02019; says Kamoun. At about 250 megabases (Mb), it's about twice the size of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> genome. His latest research, published in the <italic>Journal of</italic>
<italic>Biological Chemistry</italic> (<xref rid="pbio-0020213-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al. 2004</xref>), describes a <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> protease inhibitor&#x02014;extracellular protease inhibitor 1 (EPI1)&#x02014;that could be one of a unique class of suppressor proteins that <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> deploy to infect and counteract host defences. The pathogen seems to upregulate the <italic>epi1</italic> gene during colonisation of its host. EPI1 inhibits plant apoplastic proteases&#x02014;extracellular enzymes that are part of the host's defensive armoury that have evolved to prevent foreign proteins entering cells.</p><p>&#x02018;Based on its biological activity and expression pattern, EPI1 may function as a disease effector molecule and may play an important role in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> colonisation of host apoplast,&#x02019; Kamoun and his colleagues report (<xref rid="pbio-0020213-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al. 2004</xref>). If further research confirms this function for EPI1, then it will become one of just a handful of pathogen molecules that have been shown to suppress host plant defenses. A search in sequence databases for matching motifs reveals just one similar sequence in the entire bacterial and fungal kingdoms. However, apicomplexans like <named-content content-type="genus-species">Toxoplasma gondii</named-content> that transit through the mammalian digestive tract also appear to secrete protease inhibitors allied to EPI1. This similarity suggests an analogy between plant apoplasts and mammalian digestive tracts. Both environments are rich in proteases, but nevertheless are colonised by a variety of microbial pathogens. In the case of an apoplast, the pathogen is <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content>, whilst in the mammalian gut, it's <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content>&#x02014;and although they are phylogenetically distant, these pathogens seem to have independently recruited similar secreted proteins to inhibit the defensive proteases produced by their hosts. Interestingly, whilst <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> inhibitors inhibit gut enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin, EPI1 does not, suggesting that coevolution between the inhibitors and their target proteases may shape the specificity of these pathogenic enzymes.</p><p>Armed with this new insight into the molecular cunning of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content>, Kamoun hopes that it will be possible to come up with ways of slowing disease progression. Importantly, it looks likely that protease inhibitors such as EPI1 are present in other <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> species. There are significant matches between the <italic>epi1</italic> gene sequence and motifs from at least five other closely related species. So any methods of blocking the action of protease inhibitors in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> might also work against other <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content>. The protease inhibitors are one of Kamoun's &#x02018;unknown unknowns&#x02019;. &#x02018;It's an example of something that we had absolutely no idea was in the genome,&#x02019; he says.</p><p>Even more advanced than the <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> genome project is an ongoing collaboration between the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (Blacksburg, Virginia, United States) and the US Department of Energy's Joint Genome Project based in Walnut Creek, California. The focus here is the soybean pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. sojae</named-content> and the SOD pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>, for which draft sequences are now complete (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.jgi.doe.gov/">www.jgi.doe.gov/</ext-link>). The genomes are much smaller than that of the 250-Mb <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content>&#x02014;<named-content content-type="genus-species">P. sojae</named-content> is about 90 Mb and <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> is just 55 Mb. This, in part, explains the comparative speed of these sequencing efforts. But another factor is undeniably the fear of the unknown <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>, which in 2002 netted the Virginia&#x02013;California initiative US$3,800,000 in federal funding to describe its genome. Ultimately, however, the sequence of one species will help to inform on the sequence of other related species.</p><p>Brett Tyler, Research Professor at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, is focusing on the molecular tools used by <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. sojae</named-content> to infect its host. He agrees with Kamoun that understanding this machinery is the way to devise new control measures that could give plants the upper hand in the evolutionary arms race against their <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> pests. At present, most strategies to limit the damage caused by species like <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. sojae</named-content> rely on developing resistant cultivars by selective breeding of varieties with major resistance genes&#x02014;single genes that can block a pathogen. However, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> seem able to find ways to overcome these efforts. &#x02018;<named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> is absolutely notorious for its ability to genetically change in response to a major resistance gene,&#x02019; says Tyler. &#x02018;Typically major resistance genes in potato barely last a single season.&#x02019;</p><p>Things look better for the soybean. New cultivars containing major resistance genes show resilience to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. sojae</named-content> for five to ten years. However, this resistance is starting to break down, and breeders are running out of major resistance genes with which to conjure new varieties. The alternative, says Tyler, is quantitative or multigenic resistance, which relies on getting plants to express several resistance genes at once, each of which makes a small contribution to the plant's overall resistance. It should be much harder for <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. sojae</named-content> to evolve a new attack against this kind of robust defence. The search is also on for new genes that could be used to encourage quantitative resistance to host species. One particularly promising approach is to pit pathogen against host to see which genes are switched on. The host should upregulate genes that defend it against infection and the pathogen should upregulate genes that it needs to attack. The discovery that plants produce proteases and that <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> have responded by secreting protease inhibitors to disable them is important if long-lasting solutions are to be found. &#x02018;We just need to find a way to introduce new protein-degrading enzymes into the plant that the pathogen doesn't know how to block,&#x02019; says Tyler. &#x02018;With these genomic tools we can really accelerate the pace at which we can evaluate different possible protective measures.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Epidemiology: Identifying the Culprit</title><p>An additional benefit of the abundance of genetic information is that species identification is becoming increasingly sophisticated. At a glance, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> can be mistaken for a fungus, so DNA profiling of isolates is crucial if species and strains of species are to be identified correctly so that action appropriate to each infection can be taken. Since 2000, Matteo Garbelotto, Adjunct Professor of Mycology and Forest Pathology at the University of California at Berkeley (Berkeley, California, United States), has spent a significant part of his working life tracking the spread of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> that has killed off vast tracts of oak trees in native Californian forest (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>).</p><p>DNA analysis has been crucial to confirm suspected cases of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>, and has now revealed that infections have reached at least three other US states. This spread is probably due to the movement of infected ornamentals like rhododendron (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Rhododendron</named-content> spp.) and viburnum (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Viburnum</named-content> spp.), which seem to act as carriers for the pathogen. &#x02018;What we're seeing is a parallel to what has been happening throughout Europe, where the infection has basically moved using the commercial routes of the ornamental plant industry,&#x02019; Garbelotto says.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>
<named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> in Europe</title><p>
<named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> does not appear to have the same devastating consequences in Europe as it does in the US&#x02014;at least not yet. It's not entirely clear why, but it could have something to do with the structure of the bark of different host species, suggests Garbelotto. &#x02018;We normally see more infection where we have more corrugation, and that's because water accumulates in the fissures &#x02026; where the zoospores have a chance to infect the bark.&#x02019; However, he notes, European beech (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Fagus sylvatica</named-content>) appears to be extremely susceptible to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>. &#x02018;If it reaches areas where there are a lot of beeches, it could potentially mirror what's happening in California,&#x02019; he warns.</p><p>In Europe, symptoms characteristic of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> infection were first described on rhododendrons in The Netherlands in 1993. Once this was confirmed to be the same species as the pathogen responsible for Californian SOD, there was speculation that <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> had either been introduced to the US from Europe or vice versa. However, in December 2002, it emerged that these two populations are of different mating types&#x02014;A1 in Europe and A2 in the US. The latest research from Garbelotto and his colleagues, due to be published in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycological Research</named-content> (<xref rid="pbio-0020213-Ivors1" ref-type="bibr">Ivors et al. 2004</xref>), supports this interpretation, demonstrating that although they belong to the same species, A1 and A2 are distinct lineages and have not exchanged genes for a long time. But last year, a batch of isolates from infected camellias (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Camellia</named-content> spp.) and rhododendrons in a nursery in Washington state showed that the A1 and A2 strains were living side by side. &#x02018;That was a big surprise for us,&#x02019; recalls Garbelotto. &#x02018;We had no knowledge at that point that both the European and the North American type could be present in the same nursery.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>The Threat of Recombination</title><p>Hybridisation between different species of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> can produce a new species with different properties from those of either parent. One of the best cases comes from Europe, where a new <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> emerged in 1993 that began to attack alder trees (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Alnus</named-content> spp.). Research carried out by scientists in the United Kingdom demonstrated that the alder <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> was a product of a hybridisation event between <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. cambivora</named-content> and an unknown species similar to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. fragariae</named-content>, neither of which attacks alder.</p><p>Given this propensity for <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> species to hybridise and new phenotypes to emerge, there is legitimate concern that sexual recombination between the A1 and A2 mating types could produce something more devastating than either form. Within the controlled confines of his laboratory, Garbelotto has been exploring whether the two types of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> can get it together. Initial findings are that oospores&#x02014;the product of sexual recombination&#x02014;are being produced, although most of them abort before they reach maturity. However, 30% progress further, and (microscopically, at least) look like they could be functional. &#x02018;They'll germinate,&#x02019; he predicts.</p><p>The threat that hybridisation could create a novel strain with a different host range is a concern that the UK is also taking seriously. In December 2003, an entirely new <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> was isolated from two sites in England. Although the new species&#x02014;currently referred to as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> taxon C sp. nov. (<named-content content-type="genus-species">P</named-content>. taxon C)&#x02014; appears to cause relatively mild damage to its beech and rhododendron hosts, the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) acknowledges that hybridisation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P</named-content>. taxon C with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> could have serious consequences. &#x02018;The potential for the pathogen to adapt further to its putative new environment intrinsically or via hybridisation is not known,&#x02019; note the authors of a DEFRA report on the mystery species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.defra.gov.uk/planth/pra/forest.pdf">www.defra.gov.uk/planth/pra/forest.pdf</ext-link>). &#x02018;Long-distance spread could easily occur through the movement of infected stock of rhododendron or beech and possibly other (as yet unknown) hosts,&#x02019; they warn.</p><p>DEFRA is monitoring the situation closely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020213-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, on the basis of a preliminary DNA analysis, <named-content content-type="genus-species">P</named-content>. taxon C and <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> are only distantly related, making hybridisation unlikely, says Joan Webber, Head of Pathology at the UK government's Forestry Commission. The closest known relative of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P</named-content>. taxon C is <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. boehmeriae</named-content>, a pathogen that has been recorded on several species of tree in China and Australia, and on cotton in China and Greece, suggesting possible origins for the newly described species. But, says Webber, the sequence match between <named-content content-type="genus-species">P</named-content>. taxon C and <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. boehmeriae</named-content> is only 92%&#x02014;not especially close. Much more evidence is needed to build a strong case for the origin of this new <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content>, she says.</p><fig id="pbio-0020213-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Infection of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> at a site in the UK</title><p>DEFRA is monitoring closely for signs of hybridisation with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P</named-content>. taxon C sp. nov.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020213.g004"/></fig></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Origins</title><p>Indeed, it has taken more than 150 years to track down the geographical origin of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> strain that caused the Irish potato famine. Jean Beagle Ristaino of North Carolina State University (Raleigh, North Carolina, United States) is due to publish in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycological Research</named-content> an analysis of DNA extracted from diseased potato plants preserved from the nineteenth-century Irish epidemic (<xref rid="pbio-0020213-May1" ref-type="bibr">May and Ristaino 2004</xref>). It had long been suspected that the famine was caused by the Ib strain of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content>, which is presumed to have originated in Mexico. However, Ristaino's molecular evidence spotlights the Ia strain and traces its probable roots to the Andes. The infection could have found its way from South America to Europe and the US via exports of potato seed on steamships, she speculates.</p><p>This kind of forensic treatment is more than just interesting. Tracing a <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> species to its site of origin could reveal what keeps them at bay in the areas where they are native, and might suggest new ways to manage them when they are introduced to a different ecosystem, says Garbelotto: &#x02018;There's a huge amount of information that can be learned from understanding where they're coming from.&#x02019; So where do pathogens like <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> originate? The best lead, Garbelotto says, is the ease with which it infects rhododendron. These ornamentals are natives of Asia, but there are only a few places where the climate would suit <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>. The most promising, he suggests, are the Southern Himalayas, the Tibetan plateau, or Yunnan province in China. But these are big places, and Garbelotto has plenty on his plate in his battle against the Californian SOD. &#x02018;I am not very hopeful that we'll ever be able to find out where it comes from,&#x02019; he says.</p><fig id="pbio-0020213-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Reproductive Structures of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content>

A Closer Look at <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content>
</title></caption><p>
<named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> belong to the Kingdom Stramenophiles, so are most closely related to brown algae and diatoms. Their hyphal growth and variety of spores are morphologically and physiologically similar to fungi, for which they are occasionally mistaken, but their parasitic lifestyles have independent evolutionary origins, and therefore they have alternative mechanisms of pathogenicity. Within the class Oomycetes, which comprises all manner of heterotrophic blights, mildews, and molds, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content>&#x02014;from the Greek for &#x02018;plant destroyer&#x02019;&#x02014;is a pernicious genus, costing the world's farmers thousands of millions of dollars each year in control measures and lost yield. The majority of the 60 or so <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> species that have been described are distinguished by their complex life histories, with both asexual and sexual phases and a bewildering array of associated reproductive structures. Sporangia are asexual spores that provide the pathogen with a short-lived mode of transmission. They are either broken off from the filamentous hyphae to become airborne as in the potato blight <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. infestans</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020213-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) or remain attached and divide into swimming zoospores following rains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020213-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). By contrast, chlamydospores are asexual structures that are adapted for longterm survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020213-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In the case of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Phytophthora</named-content> causing &#x02018;sudden oak death&#x02019; (<named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>) and forest dieback (<named-content content-type="genus-species">P. cinnamomi</named-content>), the chlamydospores play a crucial role, allowing the pathogen to survive from season to season. The formation of sexual structures is relatively rare, but oospores&#x02014;the product of sexual recombination&#x02014;occur in many species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020213-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Some, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. sojae</named-content>, are known as homothallic, with a single form that has both male and female reproductive structures, whilst others like <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> are heterothallic and require two different mating types to meet for sexual recombination to occur.</p></boxed-text><boxed-text id="box2" position="float"><caption><title>Box 2. Sudden Oak Death in California and Beyond</title></caption><p>In 1995, trees in oak forests in the coastal counties of California started to show a range of alarming and lethal symptoms. Since then, the disease has reached epidemic proportions, with tens of thousands of trees dying along approximately 300 km of the central Californian coastline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020213-g003">Figure 3</xref>). By 2000, the pathogen responsible had been identified as <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content>, and it is now clear that this pest has an extremely broad host range that extends to almost all woody plant species in the coastal forests of California. Many oak hosts suffer lethal branch or stem infections, whilst non-oak hosts only carry mild leaf or twig infections. The species hardest hit include tanoak (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Lithocarpus densiflora</named-content>) and the true oaks coast live oak (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Quercus agrifolia</named-content>), California black oak (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Quercus kellogii</named-content>) and Shreve's oak (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Quercus parvula</named-content> var. <named-content content-type="genus-species">shrevei</named-content>). These species develop large wounds or cankers in their woody tissue, which disrupt physiology and in extreme cases lead to death in a matter of months.</p><p>In non-oak species, <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> does not appear to cause the same damage, leaving hosts like the Californian bay laurel (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Umbellularia californica</named-content>) and rhododendrons (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Rhododendron</named-content> spp.) with the relatively mild symptoms of leaf blight and occasional branch dieback. However, these non-oak hosts probably act as reservoirs of disease and may even help it to spread. The sporangia and chlamydospores that are thought to be the main asexual propagules of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>) are readily produced on the foliage of such non-oak species, but do not seem to appear on the bark of most of the infected oak hosts.</p><p>In March 2004, <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. ramorum</named-content> was found at a large wholesale horticultural nursery in Los Angeles County. The California Department of Food and Agriculture, the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and state agriculture departments around the country are tracing all plants shipped from this nursery over the past year in an effort to identify and destroy any infected material, and hence prevent any further spread of the disease. However, the rot has already set in at nurseries in three states outside California: Oregon, Washington, and Florida. A National SOD Nursery Survey is underway to try to assess how far the disease might have spread.</p></boxed-text></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="current-aff"><p>Henry Nicholls is a freelance writer based in London, United Kingdom.
