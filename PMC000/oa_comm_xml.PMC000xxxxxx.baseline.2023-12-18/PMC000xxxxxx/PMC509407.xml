<article-title>Hormonal Regulation of Plant Growth and Development</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>How growth regulators provoke context-specific signals is a fundamental question in developmental biology. In plants, both auxin and brassinosteroids (BRs) promote cell expansion, and it was thought that they activated this process through independent mechanisms. In this work, we describe a shared auxin:BR pathway required for seedling growth. Genetic, physiological, and genomic analyses demonstrate that response from one pathway requires the function of the other, and that this interdependence does not act at the level of hormone biosynthetic control. Increased auxin levels saturate the BR-stimulated growth response and greatly reduce BR effects on gene expression. Integration of these two pathways is downstream from BES1 and Aux/IAA proteins, the last known regulatory factors acting downstream of each hormone, and is likely to occur directly on the promoters of auxin:BR target genes. We have developed a new approach to identify potential regulatory elements acting in each hormone pathway, as well as in the shared auxin:BR pathway. We show that one element highly overrepresented in the promoters of auxin- and BR-induced genes is responsive to both hormones and requires BR biosynthesis for normal expression. This work fundamentally alters our view of BR and auxin signaling and describes a powerful new approach to identify regulatory elements required for response to specific stimuli.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Although distinct sets of growth regulators - auxin and brassinosteroids - are required for cell expansion; rather than being independent signals, the response from each pathway requires the other</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The continuous shaping of plant form is a marvel of signal integration. In early seedling development this is particularly clear, as environmental cues, such as light, profoundly alter the innate morphogenetic program. How diverse pathways merge to determine a discrete cellular growth response is largely unknown. Auxin, the first plant hormone identified, has been implicated in patterning or growth of virtually every plant tissue from earliest embryo to developing fruit (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Liscum1" ref-type="bibr">Liscum and Reed 2002</xref>). Brassinosteroids (BRs), the polyhydroxylated steroid hormones of plants, have been linked to many of these same processes, including photomorphogenesis (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Clouse1" ref-type="bibr">Clouse 2002</xref>). The nature of the relationship between these hormones has remained largely undefined.</p><p>Many factors in the signal transduction pathways operating downstream from BRs and auxin have been identified. Brassinosteroid Insensitive-1 (BRI1), a plasma-membrane-localized receptor serine/threonine kinase, is essential for BR perception and accounts for most BR-binding activity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2001</xref>). A Shaggy/GSK3-type kinase, Brassinosteroid Insensitive-2 (BIN2), acts as a negative regulator of the pathway downstream of BRI1 action (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Li1" ref-type="bibr">Li and Nam 2002</xref>). When BR levels are low, proteins in the BES1/BZR1 family are hyperphosphorylated by BIN2 and targeted for degradation by the proteasome (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-He1" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al. 2002a</xref>). Upon BR perception, BIN2 is inactivated by an unknown mechanism which allows hypophosphorylated BES1/BZR1 proteins to accumulate in the nucleus, where they presumably provoke changes in gene expression (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-He1" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al. 2002a</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to BRs, no auxin receptor has been identified. However, exposure to auxin is known to promote rapid turnover of nuclear Aux/IAA proteins by ubiquitin-mediated targeting to the 26S proteasome (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Gray2" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 2001</xref>). Aux/IAAs are direct negative regulators of the Auxin Response Factor (ARF) family of transcription factors and contain four highly conserved domains numbered I to IV (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Abel1" ref-type="bibr">Abel et al. 1995</xref>). Domains III and IV are also found in most ARFs and facilitate dimerization within and between members of both families (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Ulmasov3" ref-type="bibr">Ulmasov et al. 1997b</xref>). ARF proteins bind to a conserved auxin-responsive element (AuxRE) found upstream of many auxin-regulated genes (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Ulmasov4" ref-type="bibr">Ulmasov et al. 1999</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that auxin and BRs may have a particularly close relationship among plant hormones. In a variety of bioassays representing diverse species, BRs have been shown to synergistically promote cell elongation when supplied with auxin (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Mandava1" ref-type="bibr">Mandava 1988</xref>). Clouse and colleagues examined the effect of the two hormones on gene transcription more than a decade ago, and found that while BRs could activate the expression of some auxin-responsive genes, others appeared to be auxin specific (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Clouse2" ref-type="bibr">Clouse et al. 1992</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Zurek1" ref-type="bibr">Zurek et al. 1994</xref>). They also noted that detectable BR effects required much longer treatments compared with the extremely rapid effects of auxin, and concluded that BR-mediated cell elongation effects were likely independent from the auxin signal transduction pathway. Microarray experiments, assaying approximately one-third of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, rekindled interest in the interaction between auxin and BRs, as it was found that a significant percentage of the BR genomic response comprised genes annotated as auxin responsive (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Goda1" ref-type="bibr">Goda et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Mussig1" ref-type="bibr">Mussig et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al. 2002a</xref>). Recent work from Nakamura and colleagues has shown that three genes&#x02014;<italic>IAA5, IAA19,</italic> and <italic>SAUR-AC1</italic>&#x02014;are induced by both auxin and BRs and that induction requires BR biosynthesis (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Nakamura1" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al. 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Nakamura2" ref-type="bibr">2003b</xref>).</p><p>In this work, genetic, physiological, and genomic approaches were used to dissect the relationship between auxin and BRs in seedling growth. Together these techniques demonstrated that the relationship between these hormones is far more deeply intertwined than previously suspected. Auxin and BR effects on cell elongation were found to be interdependent, and this physiological interdependency was mirrored at the transcriptional level. In addition, growth and transcriptional effects of exogenous BR treatment could be largely superceded by overstimulation of the auxin pathway. Several lines of evidence suggested that auxin:BR synergism did not depend upon biosynthetic regulation of hormone levels; rather, the two response pathways are likely to converge at the promoters of shared target genes. New computational approaches detected a number of known transcription factor&#x02013;binding motifs enriched in promoters induced by both hormones, as well as motifs which are overrepresented in promoters activated specifically by auxin or BRs. This multifaceted approach elucidates the mechanism of action of both auxin and BRs in cell expansion, and serves as a model for interrogating complex signaling networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Auxin and BRs Interact Synergistically to Promote Hypocotyl Elongation</title><p>Early studies of BR effects in a variety of bioassays suggested that there was a synergistic interaction between auxin and BRs (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Mandava1" ref-type="bibr">Mandava 1988</xref>). We confirmed and extended these studies to the reference plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> using hypocotyl (primary stem) length as a quantitative measure of growth. Both hormones are known to induce cell elongation, and exogenous BR treatment has been shown to increase hypocotyl length (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Nemhauser2" ref-type="bibr">Nemhauser et al. 2003</xref>). In contrast, addition of auxin to media has only modest effects on seedling hypocotyl elongation, likely as a result of inefficient acropetal transport from root to shoot (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 1998</xref>). However, increased temperature has been demonstrated previously to be an effective method of altering auxin levels in the shoot and leads to robust increases in hypocotyl length (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>In our conditions, hypocotyls of plants grown at 29 &#x000b0;C were approximately 1.8 times longer than those of plants grown at 22 &#x000b0;C, consistent with what has been observed by others (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2002</xref>). When exogenous brassinolide (BL), the most biologically active BR, was applied, hypocotyls of plants grown at elevated temperature exhibited a &#x0201c;kinked&#x0201d; morphology and agravitropic growth, typical of saturating BL conditions (data not shown). In order to examine the relationship between auxin and BRs, it was necessary to find conditions where auxin levels were increased but at subsaturating levels for the hypocotyl growth-promoting response. Plants grown at 26 &#x000b0;C versus 22 &#x000b0;C showed measurable increases in both hypocotyl elongation and levels of auxin intermediates (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2002</xref>). Using these conditions, it was possible to observe that plants grown at higher temperatures were more sensitive to exogenous BR treatment, both in threshold levels for response as well as in terms of absolute growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><fig id="pbio-0020258-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>BR and Auxin Pathways Are Interdependent, as Measured by Hypocotyl Elongation</title><p>(A) Mild temperature elevation causes elongation of the hypocotyl and BR hypersensitivity in WT plants.

As has been shown previously, hypocotyls of <italic>det2</italic> mutants defective in BR biosynthesis (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Li2" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 1996</xref>) fail to elongate with increased temperature (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2002</xref>). Importantly, the hypersensitivity of <italic>det2</italic> plants to exogenous BR was enhanced by increased temperature, suggesting that these two responses are tightly linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Weak <italic>bri1</italic> mutants were also unresponsive to temperature, suggesting that auxin response was dependent on a functional BR signal transduction pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The dramatic growth enhancement caused by overproduction of auxin in the <italic>yucca</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2001</xref>) requires functional <italic>BRI1,</italic> as <italic>yucca bri1</italic> mutants are dwarfs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Conversely, BR response was dependent on a functional auxin signal transduction pathway as <italic>axr1</italic> (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Lincoln1" ref-type="bibr">Lincoln et al. 1990</xref>) and <italic>axr2</italic> (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Timpte1" ref-type="bibr">Timpte et al. 1994</xref>) mutants with reduced auxin response showed significantly reduced sensitivity to BR treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g001">1</xref>E). The degree of BR insensitivity is correlated with the level of reduced auxin responsiveness, as <italic>tir1</italic> mutants, which show only subtle phenotypes in the absence of exogenous auxin (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Ruegger1" ref-type="bibr">Ruegger et al. 1998</xref>), exhibited only a modest reduction in BR response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). <italic>axr3</italic> mutants, which in many assays display a constitutive auxin response (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Leyser1" ref-type="bibr">Leyser et al. 1996</xref>), were insensitive to BRs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). This suggests that the BR insensitivity observed in <italic>axr1</italic> and <italic>axr2</italic> mutants is not simply a block in cell elongation, and that regulated turnover of Aux/IAA proteins, such as those encoded by <italic>AXR2</italic> and <italic>AXR3,</italic> is required for normal BR response. <italic>yucca</italic> mutants were also largely insensitive to exogenous BR and appeared saturated for the BR response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g001">Figure 1</xref>H).</p><fig id="pbio-0020258-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Enhanced Hypocotyl Elongation of <italic>yucca</italic> Mutants Requires Functional BRI1</title><p>(A) Average hypocotyl lengths of 3-d-old plants.

To identify potential regulatory elements acting in these pathways, a list of all genes regulated by either auxin or BR was generated, and 500 bp upstream of each gene were identified. These promoters were split into three groups: those with increased transcript levels following treatment with BR only (B group; <italic>n</italic> = 258), those with increased transcript levels following auxin treatment only (A group; <italic>n</italic> = 254), and those genes whose transcripts were induced following treatment with either hormone (AB group; <italic>n</italic> = 82). Known plant promoter elements and their annotations were downloaded from PLACE (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Higo1" ref-type="bibr">Higo et al. 1999</xref>) and used to screen each promoter list. The expected number of occurrences of each PLACE motif was estimated using 1,000 sets of <italic>n</italic> promoters randomly sampled from the genome, where <italic>n</italic> is equal to the number of promoters in each group (A, B, or AB). This approach offers a significant advantage over other background models used to assess enrichment. Permuted distributions reflect real expected frequencies and do not rely on assumptions about genome architecture. In addition, the normal distribution of site frequencies observed with large numbers of permutations allows for the use of powerful parametric statistical methods. Moreover, the ease of filtering based on relative probabilities makes this approach ideally suited to comparisons of promoters regulated in different conditions.

Surprisingly, this sequence was not significantly enriched in the A set (<italic>p</italic> = 0.78). However, the A, B, and AB groups showed significant enrichment of the core ARF-binding element TGTC in their promoters, perhaps reflecting some sequence divergence between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and soybean, where the element was first identified.

In <italic>det2</italic> plants with lower endogenous levels of BRs (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Li2" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 1996</xref>), DR5 expression was greatly reduced, particularly in the shoot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g004">Figure 4</xref>A versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020258-g004">4</xref>C).

These data strongly suggest that the ARF-binding element requires both hormones for proper expression and should be considered a Brassinosteroid-Auxin Response Element. This finding raises questions about the utility of the DR5 element as a reporter of auxin response, as it likely reflects regions of regulatory overlap between the two pathways.</p><p>Consensus binding sites for several families of transcription factors were identified as enriched in the AB set (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020258-t001">Table 1</xref>). The presence of a MYC consensus site in more than 80% of AB promoters was quite striking, especially in light of the BR and auxin inducibility of the bHLH-containing <italic>Brassinosteroid Enhanced Expression 1</italic> (<italic>BEE1;</italic> At1g18400) gene, which is known to function in BR response (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Friedrichsen1" ref-type="bibr">Friedrichsen et al. 2002</xref>). Many of the other AB consensus motif matches were implicated in regulation by light or abscisic acid (ABA), both of which have been linked previously to BR-mediated growth response by physiology and genetics (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Nemhauser1" ref-type="bibr">Nemhauser and Chory 2002</xref>). For the B set, there was widespread occurrence of a GT-1 consensus binding motif, as well as evidence for a MYB-binding site distinct from that found in the A set. Identification of several elements specific for the A set, including those known to bind WRKY-family members, suggests attractive targets for designing new reporters which may not be BR dependent. Several instances of light-regulated motifs are intriguing given the strong evidence for a close relationship between auxin and light responses (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Reed 2001</xref>).</p><p>Several of the promoter elements identified in the A, B, and AB promoters were found as multiple copies within promoters, including the core ARF-binding element TGTC. Recent studies have suggested that ARF dimerization is not required for activation of ARFAT-mediated transcription (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Tiwari1" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al. 2003</xref>). Interestingly, a scan of AB promoters revealed that nearly half of all AB promoters contain at least one instance of multiple copies of the core TGTC element within a 50-bp window. Clustering of TGTC sites was also seen in the A set (42% of promoters contain at least one pair of sites within 50 bp) and somewhat less frequently in the B set (33%). This finding suggests that interactions between ARFs may be important for hormone responsiveness of natural promoters, in addition to enhancing auxin inducibility of synthetic multimerized ARFATs. As specific binding factors are not known for most of the other elements identified, exact nucleotides required for factor binding are not known. Therefore, this analysis is likely a conservative estimate for the number of true transcription factor&#x02013;binding sites present in each promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the notable exception of auxin, most plant hormones are produced and perceived throughout the plant body. Modulation of hormone response stems from regulation of hormone levels and/or signal transduction components, as well as from interactions with other signaling pathways. There are many examples of cross-talk between hormones in plant biology. In addition to auxin and BRs, gibberellins (GAs), ethylene, ABA, and cytokinin have all been shown to affect hypocotyl elongation (reviewed in <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Nemhauser1" ref-type="bibr">Nemhauser and Chory 2002</xref>). As mentioned previously, some of these hormones interact through biosynthetic regulation. For example, auxin, ABA, and cytokinin stimulate ethylene biosynthesis, particularly when supplied at high levels (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Hoffman 1984</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Ghassemian1" ref-type="bibr">Ghassemian et al. 2000</xref>). Physiological and genetic evidence suggests that auxin, GAs, and ethylene promote hypocotyl growth by largely independent means (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Collett1" ref-type="bibr">Collett et al. 2000</xref>). Similarly, BRs and GAs interact additively in most cell elongation bioassays (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Mandava2" ref-type="bibr">Mandava et al. 1981</xref>), and analysis of <italic>bri1</italic> mutants suggests that the two hormones independently and antagonistically regulate transcription of some target genes (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Bouquin1" ref-type="bibr">Bouquin et al. 2001</xref>). In contrast, auxin and BRs interact synergistically and interdependently to promote hypocotyl cell elongation, making their relationship unique among plant growth regulators.</p><p>The nature of hormone interactions may be tissue specific. A recent study demonstrated that auxin acts primarily through GAs to promote root elongation, and proposed that the DELLA family of negative regulators was a point of convergence between the two pathways (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Harberd 2003</xref>). One possible complication for this interpretation is that auxin is required for normal GA biosynthesis in pea (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">Ross et al. 2000</xref>) and thus, the effects of auxin on DELLA protein stability may be indirect. We have preliminary evidence that interactions between auxin and BRs may be different in aerial tissues than in roots. While auxin and BRs promote hypocotyl elongation, the hormones have opposite effects on root hair growth (J. L. Nemhauser and J. Chory, unpublished data). In addition, reduced BR levels or response may actually increase auxin effects on root pericycle proliferation (J. L. Nemhauser, N. Geldner, and J. Chory, unpublished data).</p><p>While auxin and BRs stimulate elongation of the hypocotyl, light antagonizes this effect. The AB genes induced by auxin and BRs may be targets for repression by the light response. Plants with reduced BR levels or response show a light-grown phenotype even when grown in the dark, including a short hypocotyl, expansion of cotyledons, and production of leaves. Many mutants with stabilized Aux/IAA proteins also show this deetiolated phenotype (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Reed 2001</xref>). Levels of BRs may be light regulated (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al. 2001</xref>), and response to BRs is affected by light quality and intensity (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Nemhauser2" ref-type="bibr">Nemhauser et al. 2003</xref>). Interestingly, two photoreceptors, PHOT1 (At3g45780) and Phytochrome E (At4g18130), are both downregulated by BRs. Two potential negative regulators of the light response, PKS1-like (At5g04190) and DRT100 (At3g12610), are upregulated by both auxin and BRs. Differential regulation of target genes by auxin, BRs, and light may allow fine-tuning of the photomorphogenetic response.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Bioinformatic Analysis of Signaling Networks</title><p>The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is complex and is largely mediated by multiple transcription factors that bind within regulatory regions upstream of the coding sequence. In the simplest model, coexpressed genes exhibit similar expression characteristics because they are regulated by the same transcription factors. A number of algorithms have been developed to identify potential regulatory motifs overrepresented in the promoter sequences of coregulated genes (reviewed in <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Rombauts1" ref-type="bibr">Rombauts et al. 2003</xref>). Each algorithm requires a background model to calculate the expected frequency for each motif. The simplest background model estimates the expected frequency for a given motif based on the single nucleotide composition of the analyzed sequences (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr">Bailey and Elkan 1995</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">Roth et al. 1998</xref>).

For each motif under consideration, we modeled the expected frequency distribution by randomly sampling sets of promoter sequences from among all the genes represented on the microarrays used in our study. Therefore, we could directly estimate the statistical significance for each motif from its Z score, which is the number of standard deviations by which the observed frequency exceeds the expected frequency based on the distribution observed in the permutation sampling. In contrast to other methods, our approach uses a background model based on a real distribution of motif counts derived from annotated promoter sequences, rather than estimating expected word frequencies from simulated or randomly selected genomic sequences or from models based on distribution functions. Thus, given any set of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes clustered on the basis of similar expression, we could easily identify overrepresented known transcription factor&#x02013;binding motifs or overrepresented novel presumptive promoter elements. For example, new experiments assaying genomic effects of different hormone treatments or environmental conditions could be used to define finer groupings of coregulated genes and could be readily integrated into our current analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>A Model for Auxin:BR Synergy</title><p>Auxin:BR synergism results from convergence of the two response pathways on a common mechanism for promoting cell elongation. The integration of these hormone signals occurs very late in signal transduction, likely at the promoters of more than 80 genes whose expression is induced by short treatments with either hormone. Several known regulatory elements have been identified in these common target genes. The well-characterized auxin-response element ARFAT is one crucial node of intersection between the BR and auxin pathways, as it is BR responsive and requires BR synthesis for normal expression. More than 20 ARFs have been identified in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Liscum1" ref-type="bibr">Liscum and Reed 2002</xref>).

For example, glucocorticoids synergistically enhance the effects of retinoic acid in mouse cells (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Subramaniam1" ref-type="bibr">Subramaniam et al. 2003</xref>). Upon ligand binding, the glucocorticoid receptor directly interacts with the homeodomain protein Pbx1 and activates transcription of Hoxb-1. In <italic>Xenopus,</italic> transcriptional activation of several genes, including <italic>twin, siamois,</italic> and <italic>nodal-related-3,</italic> requires stimulation of both TGF&#x003b2; and WNT pathways.

This type of coregulation is also seen in plants. One example is the synergistic interaction between osmotic stress and ABA response, which is likely mediated by interaction between DREB and AREB transcription factors (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Narusaka1" ref-type="bibr">Narusaka et al. 2003</xref>). In all of these cases, signal integration is achieved by formation of a complex containing transcription factors independently regulated by each pathway, often binding to composite regulatory elements. By integrating the inputs of multiple pathways, these mechanisms provide cellular or regional specificity for a given response.</p><p>ARFAT was originally identified as part of a composite element (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Ulmasov1" ref-type="bibr">Ulmasov et al. 1995</xref>). However, DR5 has been characterized as a multimerized simple response element (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Ulmasov3" ref-type="bibr">Ulmasov et al. 1997b</xref>) and can be activated by either auxin or BRs. So, unlike in the systems described above, auxin and BR signals likely converge on the same family of transcription factors. Such a relationship has recently been described for ethylene and jasmonate in plant defense responses (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Lorenzo1" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzo et al. 2003</xref>). Both ethylene and jasmonate pathways are required to induce expression of the transcription factor ERF1, which in turn regulates the expression of a number of defense-related genes. Neither auxin nor BRs have large effects on ARF transcription, and several AB targets are early-response genes not requiring de novo protein synthesis for activation (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Friedrichsen1" ref-type="bibr">Friedrichsen et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Liscum1" ref-type="bibr">Liscum and Reed 2002</xref>). Auxin and BRs likely regulate ARF complex activity posttranslationally rather than through transcriptional regulation. Auxin is already known to modulate ARF activity by regulating the stability of the interacting Aux/IAA repressor proteins (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Gray2" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Tiwari1" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al. 2003</xref>). BR perception could increase ARF activity by leading to modification of the ARFs themselves or through interactions with a BR-regulated transcriptional coactivator. The additional transcriptional regulation of some ARFs by BRs, together with auxin and BR effects on a number of Aux/IAA genes, could favor formation of particular transcriptional complexes promoting growth. Five genes encoding proteins with DNA-binding motifs were induced by both hormones, including members of the MYC, EREBP, and leucine zipper families. Higher-order interactions among several transcription factor complexes, perhaps directly involving members of the BES1/BZR1 family, could provide additional control of the shared auxin:BR response pathway.</p><p>A longstanding question in plant biology has been how a small number of hormones with overlapping functions can provoke a wide range of responses. Combinatorial control has long been suggested as one possible explanation (e.g., <xref rid="pbio-0020258-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">Singh 1998</xref>). The detailed analysis of BR and auxin pathways in this work suggests that hormone response is determined by the cellular milieu. Additional factors, including other hormones and environmental stimuli, can be incorporated into this model, leading ultimately to a detailed map of plant growth processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Hypocotyl measurements</title><p>Seeds were sterilized for 15 min in 70% ethanol, 0.01% Triton X-100, followed by 10 min of 95% ethanol.

Total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen (Valencia, California, United States) RNAeasy kit and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using an Invitrogen Superscript First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit. cDNAs were diluted 20-fold and combined with SYBR master mix (PE Biosystems, Wellesley, California, United States) for PCR. Primers were as follows: At5g64770 (5&#x02032;-CTTCTCATACTCTTCATTTCCTCTCCTACT-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-TTCTCGTAAGCTTCGTGCTTGA-3&#x02032;), At1g18400 (5&#x02032;-CTAGCGGCGTCTCCGATAAT-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-AAGAACCTGTTTCAGTGGCAATAAC-3&#x02032;), At1g10550 (5&#x02032;-AAGCTTCCCGCTGGATTTG-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-TTGATAAATAGAAAGCAACCACAACAC-3&#x02032;), and At4g30290 (5&#x02032;-TCCCTGGTAACTCTGCTGGAA-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-CCGGAGATTTAAGATAGAATGTTGTGA-3&#x02032;).

One thousand surrogates of each promoter set were created by randomly shuffling the list of genes represented on the Affymetrix ATH1 arrays and then sampling <italic>n</italic> genes and extracting 500-bp promoter sequences for the sampled set of genes. Known plant promoter elements and their annotation were downloaded from PLACE (<xref rid="pbio-0020258-Higo1" ref-type="bibr">Higo et al. 1999</xref>). For each set of <italic>n</italic> promoters, the null distribution for each PLACE motif was modeled by counting the number of occurrences for each word within each of the 1,000 surrogate sets of <italic>n</italic> promoters. Using this approach we could then ask how well the observed frequency of a certain motif in a set of <italic>n</italic> promoters matched the frequency that would be expected for a random set of <italic>n</italic> promoters. We estimated the one-tailed <italic>p</italic> value for each motif based on the Z score of the difference of the actual word count of the promoter set (C<sub>true</sub>) minus the mean count from the 1,000 surrogates (C<sub>surr</sub>) relative to the SD from the 1,000 surrogates (SD<sub>surr</sub>) [i.e., Z = (C<sub>true</sub> &#x02212; C<sub>surr</sub>)/SD<sub>surr</sub>]. Thus for each motif the <italic>p</italic> value we calculated was the probability to the right of the observed count calculated on the null distribution derived from sampling promoters randomly from the genome. We considered a motif to be significantly overrepresented if this probability was less than 0.1. These calculations were implemented using Perl scripts and a relational database (MySQL).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Fold Change of BL-Upregulated Genes following Exposure to BL or IAA (Auxin) Treatment</title><p>Effects of increased auxin levels in the <italic>yucca</italic> mutant are shown as compared to WT and following BL treatments.
