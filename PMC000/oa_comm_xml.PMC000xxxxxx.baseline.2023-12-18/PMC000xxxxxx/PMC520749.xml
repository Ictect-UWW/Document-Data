Association of altered DNA methylation patterns of the promoter CpG islands with the expression profile of  cancer-related genes, has been found in many human tumors. Therefore, DNA methylation status as such may serve as an epigenetic biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis of human tumors, including astrocytoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used the methylation specific PCR in conjunction with sequencing verification to establish the methylation profile of the promoter CpG island of thirty four genes in astrocytoma tissues from fifty three patients (The WHO grading:. I: 14, II: 15, III: 12 and IV: 12 cases, respectively). In addition, compatible tissues (normal tissues distant from lesion) from three non-astrocytoma patients were included as the control.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventeen genes (<italic>ABL, APC, APAF1, BRCA1, CSPG2, DAPK1, hMLH1, LKB1, PTEN, p14<sup>ARF</sup>, p15<sup>INK4b</sup>, p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, p57<sup>KIP2</sup>, RASSF1C, RB1, SURVIVIN</italic>, and <italic>VHL</italic>) displayed a uniformly unmethylated pattern in all the astrocytoma and non-astrocytoma tissues examined. However, the <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>gene that was inactivated and hypermethylated in non-astrocytoma tissues, was partially demethylated in 24.5% of the astrocytoma tissues (co-existence of the hypermethylated and demethylated alleles). Of the astrocytoma associated hypermethylated genes, the methylation pattern of the <italic>CDH13, cyclin a1, DBCCR1, EPO, MYOD1</italic>, and <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4a </italic></sup>genes changed in no more than 5.66% (3/53) of astrocytoma tissues compared to non-astrocytoma controls, while the <italic>RASSF1A, p73, AR, MGMT, CDH1, OCT6,, MT1A, WT1</italic>, and <italic>IRF7 </italic>genes were more frequently hypermethylated in 69.8%, 47.2%, 41.5%, 35.8%, 32%, 30.2%, 30.2%, 30.2% and 26.4% of astrocytoma tissues, respectively. Demethylation mediated inducible expression of the <italic>CDH13, MAGEA1, MGMT, p73 </italic>and <italic>RASSF1A </italic>genes was established in an astrocytoma cell line (U251), demonstrating that expression of these genes is likely regulated by DNA methylation. <italic>AR gene </italic>hypermethylation was found exclusively in female patients (22/27, 81%, 0/26, 0%, P &#x0003c; 0.001), while the <italic>IRF7 gene </italic>hypermethylation preferentially occurred in the male counterparts (11/26, 42.3% to 3/27, 11%, P &#x0003c; 0.05). Applying the mathematic method "the Discovery of Association Rules", we have identified groups consisting of up to three genes that more likely display the altered methylation patterns in concert in astrocytoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Of the thirty four genes examined, sixteen genes exhibited astrocytoma associated changes in the methylation profile. In addition to the possible pathological significance, the established concordant methylation profiles of the subsets consisting of two to three target genes may provide useful clues to the development of the useful prognostic as well as diagnostic assays for astrocytoma.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma is a leading group of the primary central nervous system tumors, accounting for more than 60% of all primary brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It may arise aggressively from the normal astrocytes, or evolve stepwise from the less its benign precursors. Owing to the difficulties with its early diagnosis and surgical removal of all residue diseased tissues, rapid progression, and frequent reoccurrence, the most advanced form of astrocytoma, glioblastoma (WHO grading IV) represents an extremely life-threatening intracranial malignant tumor both inside and outside of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Molecular genetic analyses have demonstrated multiple genetic lesions implicating to pathogenesis of astrocytoma, glioblastoma in particular. In addition to the frequent amplification and deletion of the EGF receptor gene (<italic>EGFR</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the main genetic events affecting the following tumor suppressor genes: the members of the <italic>INK4A </italic>initiated cell-cycle arrest pathway (the <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4a</italic></sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF </italic></sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the <italic>RB1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and <italic>the p53 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), a wide spectrum of the cell surface receptor genes (i.e., <italic>CD44</italic>, <italic>integrin</italic>, and receptors for various growth factors), and the <italic>PTEN </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Transcription in eukaryotes is regulated at multiple levels and inversely correlated with the hypermethylated state as well as the chromatin condensation. It has been well established that the methylation status of CpG islands directly affects the DNA-protein interactions by eliminating the otherwise occurring sequence specific binding of the transcription factors whereas inducing the DNA-bindings of members of the methyl-CpG binding protein family (MBD). Histone modifications (deacetylation and methylation) may occur subsequently leading to chromatin condensation and a long-term transcriptional silencing status of the affected DNA segments. Over 40% of the protein coding genes have at least one CpG island within or near to their promoter, an strong indication for transcription of which is likely to be under the control of DNA methylation status. Three DNA methyl transferases are involved in the control of the methylation state of the CpGs in genome. DNA methyl transferase I is mainly responsible for the maintenance of the methylation status of the genome after DNA replication, while IIIA and IIIB act principally in the <italic>de novo </italic>DNA methylation in the early development of high eukaryotes. DNA methylation patterns in somatic cells are established during the early development and contribute to the allele-specific transcription silencing of the imprinted genes, including the silenced alleles in the X-chromosome and other chromosomes. The epigenetic pattern (the DNA methylation profiles of the genome) in high eukaryotes is integral to the normal execution of the biological activities in cells and needs to be actively maintained. In addition to the changes linked to the cell lineage specific pattern of gene expression, both global hypomethylation and local hypermethylation of the CpG islands occur progressively as cell ages.</p><p>Aberrant DNA methylation pattern changes gene transcription that has been etiologically linked to cancer formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The genome-wide hypomethylation has been believed to activate transcription of the otherwise silenced transposon like repetitive sequences (such as the Alu and LINE repeats in mammals). As a result, the transposition occurs more prevalently so that the genomic instability in cancer cells will be significantly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The hypermethylated state of the promoter CpG islands has been etiologically associated with transcription inactivation of a number of tumor suppressor genes in tumors, which are hypomethylated and transcribed in their normal counterparts. Therefore, the hypermethylated CpG island(s) of those genes have been regarded as a defect, reminiscent to the loss of heterozygosity or other types of genetic deletion for total inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes in cancer. The most noticeable example is the <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4a </italic></sup>gene that has been frequently hypermethylated in almost all types of the tumors examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] including hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The loss of the genetic imprinting (changes in DNA methylation status) has been found to reactivate transcription of the otherwise silenced allele of the genes such as the insulin like growth factor 2 gene, which has been well documented in human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, the reverse process, i.e., demethylation of the promoter CpG island, has also been found instrumental to the transcription activation of the otherwise inert genes in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A prominent example is the gene encoding the melanoma antigen, MAGEA1 that was hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced in the normal liver tissues, and demethylated prevalently in the hepatocellular carcinoma tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], correlating well with the elevated level of its expression in HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The over-expressed gene, <italic>SURVIVIN</italic>, has also been reported to be demethylated in human ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Despite of the fact that the elevated levels of expression of three DNA methyl transferase genes were detected in virtually all cancers, the profiles of the hypermethylated genes vary with both the types and stages of cancers. Therefore, the undefined defects in the epigenetic homeostasis during carcinogenesis, rather than the aberrant expression of any given DNA methyl transferase, are more likely to account for the cancer type specific pattern of DNA methylation at both global and local levels.</p><p>Methylation profiling of the promoter CpG islands has been an important information gathering process for new insights into our understanding of the role of DNA methylation in both initiation and progression of human carcinogenesis. It would result in development of the DNA methylation based assays for cancer diagnosis as well as identification of the cancer genes suffering from the epigenetic defects <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.missouri.edu/~hypermet/list_of_promoters.htm"/>. However, as the majority of studies had only targeted one or a few genes in rather small patient groups, the concurrent hypermethylation behavior of multiple genes has only been addressed in a limited number of tumor types, such as colorectal cancer. The majority, if not all, of the previous studies on the astrocytoma associated changes in methylation profiles have only examined a small number of genes for methylation status at the promoter CpG island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this study, we determined the methylation profiles of as many as thirty four genes in a cohort consisting of 53 astrocytoma patients and established the concordant methylation behavior of up to three targets. Our observations should provide new insights into the DNA methylation epigenetic defects in human astrocytoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All the experiments were performed according to protocols described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

No significant geographic impart was observed as patients came from different places in China and went to Beijing for treatment. In addition, the compatible tissues (normal tissues distant from the lesions) were surgically obtained from three non-astrocytoma patients [gangliocytoma (21 years old, male), angiocavernoma (49 years old, male) and meningioma (54 years old, female)] as the normal controls, which have been subjected to the proper pathological evaluation.</p><p>Total genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissue specimens (50 &#x02013; 100 mg) according to a standard protocol with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

In contrast, these genes were hypermethylated to various extents in the astrocytoma samples.

No significant changes of these six genes shown in here acted against the notion that DNA methylation related mechanisms underline potential inactivation of this set of genes in the pathogenesis of astrocytoma. The infrequent hypermethylation of the <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4a </italic></sup>gene in astrocytoma was a total surprise, as it was frequently reported hypermethylated in various human tumors tested, including in HCC where we have previously found that the <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4a</italic></sup>, <italic>MYOD1</italic>, <italic>CDH13 </italic>and <italic>cyclin a1 </italic>genes were frequently methylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

Silencing of the <italic>MGMT </italic>gene has been suggested to predispose the neoplastic clones to acquisition of the guanine to adenine point mutations in K-<italic>ras </italic>and <italic>p53 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and is associated with low-levels of micro-satellite instability in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. We found that the <italic>MGMT </italic>gene was prevalently hypermethylated in astrocytoma (35%, 19/53), and its transcription could be reactivated by demethylation with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine in U251 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Hence, the <italic>MGMT </italic>hypermethylation in astrocytoma may indeed have the pathological significance. In this connection, a recent report suggested that the astrocytoma sensitivity to the alkylating type of chemotherapeutics might be contributed by the hypermethylated <italic>MGMT </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Expression of the metallothionein I A (<italic>MT1A</italic>) is inducible by a number of adversary agents such as heavy metals and oxidative stress. Both basal and inducible expression of this gene has been impaired in various tumor cell lines and attributed to the hypermethylated state of this gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In this study, we found that the <italic>MT1A </italic>gene was hypermethylated in 30% (16/53) of cases, with no significant gender and grading difference. The functional and pathological implications of the <italic>MT1A </italic>hypermethylation in astrocytoma remain to be established.</p><p>Cadherins, the calcium-dependent proteins, contribute to various biological processes such as differentiation, migration and extra-cellular signal transduction of cell. Loss of expression of both E-cadherin (<italic>CDH1</italic>) and H-cadherin (<italic>CDH13</italic>) has been found in parallel with the hypermethylated promoter CpG islands in various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In this study, we found that the <italic>CDH1 </italic>gene was hypermethylated in 32.8% (17/53) of astrocytoma tissues, while the <italic>CDH13 </italic>gene was not methylated in all the astrocytoma tissues examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional files 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). In contrast, in human hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the <italic>CDH1 </italic>gene was unmethylated, while the CDH13 <italic>gene </italic>was frequently hypermethylated. Obviously, the molecular basis for tumor type specific methylation patterns of these two genes remains to be determined.</p><p>Although the hypermethylation mediated gene silencing of the tumor suppressor genes is at the focal point of the epigenetic studies, demethylated status of the promoter CpG islands has been linked to the tumor associated activation of the normally silenced genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, we also studied both <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>and <italic>SURVIVIN </italic>genes. The promoter CpG islands were hypermethylated in normal tissues (for <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>in HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and for <italic>SURVIVIN </italic>in ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) and demethylated in parallel with the transcriptional activation in tumor cells. The unmethylated status of the <italic>SURVIVIN </italic>gene in astrocytoma is consistent with the over-expression of this gene (unpublished observations). However, its unmethylated status in all the non-astrocytoma tissues acts odd with the notion that its demethylation is associated with pathogenesis in human ovarian cancer reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Our previous studies indicated that demethylation of the promoter CpG island was correlated well with the over-expression profile of the <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in HCC. The <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>gene was fully hypermethylated in all four cases of the normal liver tissues but significantly demethylated in HCC tissues (21/28, 75%). It was found fully hypermethylated in all the three control tissues and in 74.5% (40/53) of the astrocytoma tissues and partially hypermethylated (13/53, 25.5%) in the other astrocytoma tissues. The occurrence of the <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>demethylation in HCC differed significantly from astrocytoma (75% verse 25.5%, P &#x0003c; 0.001). As it was fully methylated in the normal tissue, the partial hypermethylation (both hypermethylated and demethylated alleles existed) would imply that the event resulting in the loss of the hypermethylation state of the <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>gene indeed occurred in astrocytoma and should be scored positive for the changes in the methylation pattern in this study. The same principle has been applied for the opposite changes from the unmethylated pattern in the normal control to the partial or full hypermethylated status of all the other genes in astrocytoma tissues. It was also found that the partial demethylated status of the <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>gene in U251 cells induced by 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine occurred co-currently with activation of its transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The gender association of the methylation profiles of the AR and IRF7 gene in astrocytoma</title><p>By statistic analysis with both Pearson Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact tests, associations of the DNA methylation profiles of the targets displaying no less than 24.5% changes (the <italic>RASSF1A, p73, MGMT, CDH1, OCT6, WT1 </italic>as well as <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>genes) with the clinical pathological parameters (age, grading and gender) were assessed. The methylation profiles of the <italic>AR </italic>and <italic>IRF7 </italic>genes were found gender-oriented.</p><p>The <italic>AR </italic>gene encodes the androgen receptor that plays a key role in the signal transduction pathways in response to the male steroid hormone, androgen and has been reported to be inactivated via the epigenetic mechanism in prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Physiologically, the AR gene should express exclusively in the somatic cells in males, while lacking of its expression in females is likely mediated by DNA methylation based mechanisms. Indeed, the hypermethylated along with the unmethylated AR genes were only found in the normal female brain tissue, but not from two male non-astrocytoma samples. The hypermethylation of the AR gene occurred frequently in the female group (81.5%, 22/27) but not in any males (0%, 0/26, &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>= 36.22, P = 0.000). It may simply be gender associated and do not have any significant relevance to carcinogenesis of astrocytoma. It was also noticed that hypermethylation of the IRF7 gene displayed an opposite gender inclination, detected in 11% of the female patients (3/27), and 42% of male patients (11/26, &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>= ?6.632, P = 0.014). Despite of the difficulty to offer a mechanistic interpretation, the potential prognostic value of such a gender-associated phenomenon might be worthwhile exploring in future.</p></sec><sec><title>Demethylation by 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of the astrocytoma cells in culture resulted in partial demethylation and reactivated expression of the genes</title><p>The hypermethylated status of the promoter CpG island has been linked to gene transcription silencing in a number of biological settings. The effect of the astrocytoma associated changes in the methylated state of the promoter CpG islands detected in this study on gene expression was assessed in U251 astrocytoma cells treated with the a demethylating agent, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. We used MSP to establish the methylation status of the promoter CpG island of all the genes with the astrocytoma associated methylation changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional files 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>) in U251 astrocytoma cells, and analyzed the ability of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine to demethylate five genes, as measured by MSP, and reactivate their expression, as detected by RT-PCR.</p><p>As shown in panel 1 of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, while the <italic>CDH13</italic>, <italic>MAGEA1 </italic>and <italic>p73 </italic>genes were heterozygously methylated, both <italic>MGMT </italic>and <italic>RASSF1A </italic>genes were fully hypermethylated in U251 cells. The <italic>CDH13 </italic>gene was found expressed, while the rest transcriptionally inert as measured by the RT-PCR. Although both methylated and unmethylated alleles for <italic>p73 </italic>and <italic>MGMT </italic>genes were evident in U251 cells, no expression was detected, indicating that the unmethylated allele may remain silent by the other mechanisms, including the genetic defects at critical control region. By the 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment, both demethylation of the promoter CpG island and activation of transcription of these five genes were achieved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Despite of the fact that demethylation of the promoter CpG islands was incomplete in samples treated with 20 nM 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the expression of this five genes was either induced (the <italic>MAGEA1</italic>, <italic>MGMT</italic>, <italic>p73 </italic>and <italic>RASSF1A </italic>genes) or elevated (the <italic>CDH13 </italic>gene).</p></sec><sec><title>The concordant methylation behavior of the promoter CpG islands of the genes in Astrocytoma</title><p>The DNA methylation mediated epigenetic changes also display the tumor type specific patterns, which seem to reflect the differentiation and maturation histories of the cell lineages as well as the aging process during which both global hypo- and local hyper-methylation occur. Hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands in accord with the transcriptional silencing of the tumor suppressor genes, such as the p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, and RASSF1A genes, has been well established in human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether there is a common mechanism for the concurrent methylation changes of multiple tumor suppressor genes in tumors. To address this matter, it is necessary to examine a large number of genes for frequent changes in methylation in any type of human tumors. The concordant methylation behavior of multiple genes was firstly detected in colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>], based upon a comprehensive methylation profiling of over thirty genes. In this study, we have profiled the methylation status of thirty four genes in a cohort of 53 astrocytoma and 3 non-astrocytoma patients. Twenty three of these genes had not been studied previously in astrocytoma. As far as the number of the genes is concerned, this study is the most extensive in the astrocytoma field to our knowledge. Among thirty four genes, sixteen genes exhibited the astrocytoma associated changes in methylation profiles of the promoter CpG islands and nine genes displayed rather frequent changes (the occurrence &#x02265; 13/53, frequency &#x02265; 24.5%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Additional file 8</xref>).</p><p>Four of 53 cases (7.5%) maintained the same methylation profile as the normal control. The rest 49 cases (92.5%) suffered from the methylation changes as much as no less than one target, an occurrence was significantly lower than in HCC, where all the cases displayed methylation changes affecting no less than three targets in the studies involved with twenty or twenty four targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], indicating that alterations in DNA methylation \occur more frequently in HCC than in astrocytoma. This may be contributed by the apparent anatomic inaccessibility of the brain to environmental adverse factors in comparison to the liver. The size of the subsets containing various number of the target affected (from one to nine) ranged from 1 to 11 cases, and peaked with 10 cases at three and 11 cases at five target subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">Additional file 9</xref>). To identify the most frequent changes of the target sets (one to three), a mathematic method called "the Discovery of Association Rules" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] was used. The co-occurrence (case number/the total) and frequency (% of the total) of any subset of the targets that changed in methylation together in astrocytoma were counted and compared. In the entire cohort of patients in this study, the most altered target was the RASSF1A gene, 69.8% (37/53). The two genes that most altered together were the <italic>RASSF1A </italic>and <italic>p73 </italic>genes, hypermethylation of which was found in 20 (37.7%). Three genes that changed together were the former two plus <italic>CDH1 </italic>or <italic>OCT6</italic>, hypermethylation of which occurred in 20.8% cases (11/53) (Column 2, a, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">Additional file 10</xref>). Furthermore, the occurrence in methylation change in any target in the two gene subsets was 79.3% (42/530 and in three gene subsets was 81.1&#x02013;83% (43&#x02013;44/53) (Column 3, a, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">Additional file 10</xref>).</p><p>Since the hypermethylated <italic>AR </italic>is associated closely with the female gender of the astrocytoma patients and devoid of any association with the formation of astrocytoma, it was taken out from this analysis.

Both <italic>RASSF1A </italic>and <italic>WT1 </italic>were hypermethylated in 13 (13/27, 48.1%); and the former two plus the hypermethylated <italic>p73 </italic>or <italic>CDH1 </italic>or <italic>OCT6 </italic>were found in 9 female cases (9/27, 33.3%), respectively (Column 2, b, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">Additional file 10</xref>).
