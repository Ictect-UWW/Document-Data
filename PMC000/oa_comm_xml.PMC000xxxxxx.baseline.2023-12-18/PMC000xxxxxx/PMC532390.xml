<article-title>The History of the Intron - Balancing Gains and Losses</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Little is known about the patterns of intron gain and loss or the relative contributions of these two processes to gene evolution. To investigate the dynamics of intron evolution, we analyzed orthologous genes from four filamentous fungal genomes and determined the pattern of intron conservation. We developed a probabilistic model to estimate the most likely rates of intron gain and loss giving rise to these observed conservation patterns. Our data reveal the surprising importance of intron gain. Between about 150 and 250 gains and between 150 and 350 losses were inferred in each lineage. We discuss one gene in particular (encoding 1-phosphoribosyl-5-pyrophosphate synthetase) that displays an unusually high rate of intron gain in multiple lineages. It has been recognized that introns are biased towards the 5&#x02032; ends of genes in intron-poor genomes but are evenly distributed in intron-rich genomes. Current models attribute this bias to 3&#x02032; intron loss through a poly-adenosine-primed reverse transcription mechanism. Contrary to standard models, we find no increased frequency of intron loss toward the 3&#x02032; ends of genes. Thus, recent intron dynamics do not support a model whereby 5&#x02032; intron positional bias is generated solely by 3&#x02032;-biased intron loss.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A comparative study of four fungal genomes reveals the patterns of intron gain and loss over several hundred million years of evolution</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over a quarter of a century after the discovery of introns, fundamental questions about their function and evolutionary origins remain unanswered. Although intron density differs radically between organisms, the mechanisms by which introns are inserted and deleted from gene loci are not well understood. A correlation has been observed between intron density and positional bias (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Mourier1" ref-type="bibr">Mourier and Jeffares 2003</xref>). Introns are evenly distributed within the coding sequence of genes in intron-rich organisms, but are biased toward the 5&#x02032; ends of genes in intron-poor organisms. This bias is particularly pronounced in the yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>. It has been suggested that both the paucity and positional bias of introns in yeast may be due to intron loss through a mechanism of homologous recombination of spliced messages reverse-transcribed from the 3&#x02032; poly-adenylated tail (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Fink1" ref-type="bibr">Fink 1987</xref>). This reverse transcription mechanism was first demonstrated in experiments with intron-containing Ty elements in yeast (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Boeke1" ref-type="bibr">Boeke et al. 1985</xref>). More recently, <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Mourier1" ref-type="bibr">Mourier and Jeffares (2003)</xref> concluded that homologous recombination of cDNAs is the simplest explanation for the positional bias observed in all intron-poor eukaryotes. However, few data exist concerning the actual mechanisms and dynamics of intron evolution.</p><p>Fungal genomes are in many ways ideal for exploring questions of intron evolution. The fundamental aspects of intron biology are shared between fungi and other eukaryotes, making fungi appropriate model organisms for intron study. They are gene dense with relatively simple gene structures compared with plants and animals, making gene prediction more accurate. Fungi also display a wide diversity of gene structures, ranging from far less than one intron per gene for <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> to approximately 1&#x02013;2 introns per gene on average for many recently sequenced ascomycetes (including the organisms in this study), to roughly seven introns per gene on average for some basidiomycetes (e.g., <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>). Finally, fungi display a strong 5&#x02032; bias in intron positions, enabling us to investigate the processes underlying this phenomenon.</p><p>In principle, a 5&#x02032; intron bias could arise through various combinations of intron gain and loss, and a complete understanding of intron positional bias requires an assessment of the contributions of both of these processes. A number of studies demonstrate the occurrence of intron gain and loss in individual genes or gene families. <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Logsdon1" ref-type="bibr">Logsdon et al. (1995)</xref> offered early examples of well-supported intron gain by comparing triose-phosphate isomerase genes from diverse eukaryotes and demonstrated that numerous introns could be most parsimoniously explained by a single gain with no subsequent losses. <xref rid="pbio-0020422-OaNeill1" ref-type="bibr">O'Neill et al. (1998)</xref> later provided evidence for de novo intron insertion into the otherwise intron-less mammalian sex-determining gene <italic>SRY</italic>. Evidence for the occurrence of multiple independent intron losses has also been reported in studies such as those by <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">Robertson (2000)</xref>, who inferred gain and loss events in a family of chemoreceptors in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content>.</p><p>More recently, a number of genome-wide studies of intron dynamics have been conducted. <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al. (2003)</xref> described genome-wide comparisons between human and mouse (with <italic>Fugu</italic> as an outgroup) and between mouse and rat (with human as an outgroup), and observed a sparseness of intron loss and complete absence of intron gain in these closely related organisms. On the other hand, <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Rogozin1" ref-type="bibr">Rogozin et al. (2003)</xref> observed an abundance of lineage-specific intron loss and gain when analyzing clusters of orthologous genes in deeply branching eukaryotes. Similarly, <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al. (2004)</xref> analyzed ten protein families in distantly related eukaryotes, with a single prokaryotic outgroup, and obtained evidence that extant introns are predominantly the result of intron gains. In search of clues to understand the mechanism of intron gain, <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Fedorov1" ref-type="bibr">Fedorov et al. (2003)</xref> aligned introns from various eukaryotes, and <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Coghlan1" ref-type="bibr">Coghlan and Wolfe (2004)</xref> applied a similar approach in a comparative study of nematodes. None of these studies addressed the positional bias of intron gain and loss events. Here we report the results of a genome-wide comparative analysis of intron evolution in organisms that have a strong 5&#x02032; bias in intron location and are at an appropriate evolutionary distance to reveal positional trends in intron gain and loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the roles of both gain and loss in intron evolution, we compared the genomes of four recently sequenced fungi spanning at least 330 million years of evolution (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Berbee1" ref-type="bibr">Berbee and Taylor 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Heckman1" ref-type="bibr">Heckman et al. 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020422-g001">Figure 1</xref>): <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus nidulans</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Fusarium graminearum</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Magnaporthe grisea</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Neurospora crassa</named-content>. Ortholog sets composed of one gene from each of the four genomes were identified as pairwise best bidirectional BLAST hits satisfying stringent overlap criteria. Orthologs in each set were subsequently aligned, and the locations of introns were marked.

The gained intron has consensus terminal dinucleotides (GT&#x02026;AG) and a putative branch point sequence that matches the yeast consensus (
TACTAAC) at six of seven positions. In addition, this set of orthologs contained one poorly aligned intron position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020422-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, unedged gray rectangle) that was excluded by our filters. All three passing positions (black-edged rectangles) display high amino acid sequence conservation on both sides flanking the intron, supporting the correctness of the alignment. In contrast, the failing intron position (unedged gray rectangle) is adjacent to a region of the alignment that lacks significant conservation. The 3&#x02032; flank of this intron position displays considerable variation, especially with respect to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> gene, which was predicted to have a much longer 3&#x02032; coding region. In such an alignment region, it is difficult to distinguish true differences in intron conservation from potential annotation or alignment errors.

Contrary to what would be expected if intron loss primarily involved homologous recombination of poly-adenosine-primed reverse transcripts, the rate of intron loss tends to be lower, rather than higher, at the 3&#x02032; ends of genes. Moreover, the highest rates of intron loss occur in the middles of genes in all three organisms. We found no evidence that this pattern was affected by our filtering methods. These findings suggest either other mutational mechanisms (e.g., reverse transcription primed internally) or the presence of selective pressure to preferentially conserve introns near the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We developed a system that automatically identifies evolutionary and positional patterns of intron conservation on a genome-wide scale. The core of the system is a process for stringently filtering alignments of orthologous genes to exclude potential annotation or alignment errors. The result of the filtering process is a high-confidence set of aligned intron positions. Differences in intron conservation at each individual position can be characterized as gains or losses (or ambiguous) based on parsimony. However, this does not accurately account for the possibility of multiple gain or loss events. We have developed a probabilistic model that allows for multiple events, providing a corrected estimate of the total number of gains and losses within the dataset. Our probabilistic method allows for a more accurate assessment of rates of gain and loss. In our dataset, allowing for multiple events results in only modest corrections to the rates estimated using parsimony.</p><p>Our analysis demonstrates a significant role for intron gain over the past few hundred million years in the fungi analyzed. Previous analyses of specific gene families have provided evidence of specific instances of gained introns (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Logsdon2" ref-type="bibr">Logsdon et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">Robertson 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Hartung1" ref-type="bibr">Hartung et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al. 2004</xref>). However, the relative importance of intron gain versus loss is not well understood. Recent large-scale analyses have suggested that intron gain may play a predominant role in shaping gene structures (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al. 2004</xref>), although lineage-specific differences are apparent (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Rogozin1" ref-type="bibr">Rogozin et al. 2003</xref>). In particular, intron gain appears to occur rarely if at all in mammalian genes (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al. 2003</xref>). Our data suggest that intron gain is a significant driving force in the evolution of genes in fungi. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. graminearum</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> the number of introns gained was on par with the number lost and similar in magnitude to the number of introns gained in <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content>.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying intron gain are not known. We analyzed the set of predicted intron gains for possible signatures that might shed light on this process. No statistically significant bias was detected in the positions of gained introns along the coding sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020422-g003">Figure 3</xref> data not shown). Similarly, no preferred insertion site sequence was detectable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020422-t002">Table 2</xref>), and no significant phase bias for gained introns was observed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020422-t001">Table 1</xref>). The lack of an insertion site preference and absence of significant phase bias for gained introns in fungi is consistent with previous investigations and may set fungi apart from other organisms (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our data further indicate that intron gain can vary substantially between different gene families in a lineage-specific fashion. The PRPP synthetase gene is a particularly striking example, exhibiting significant increases in gained introns in two of the four lineages investigated. Moreover, the paucity of intron positions shared between <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> suggests the possibility of independent increases in gain rate in the two species. Alternatively, the apparent high intron gain rate exhibited by this gene may have arisen just prior to the last common ancestor of <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. crassa</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content>. Although it is premature to speculate about possible mechanisms, one possibility is that a factor or factors responsible for intron insertion evolved to associate with the PRPP synthetase gene locus, transcript, or message at this point, leading to a higher rate of intron insertion in this gene.</p><p>Finally, our results do not support the mechanism commonly proposed to account for the 5&#x02032; positional bias of introns in intron-poor organisms (<xref rid="pbio-0020422-Mourier1" ref-type="bibr">Mourier and Jeffares 2003</xref>). Contrary to what would be expected if intron loss primarily involved recombination of poly-adenosine-primed reverse transcripts, the rate of intron loss tends to be lower at the 3&#x02032; ends of genes. Instead, the highest rates of intron loss occur in the middles of genes in all three organisms. (This result is consistent with the results of <xref rid="pbio-0020422-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al. (2003)</xref> in their analysis of intron evolution in mammals. Although their report describes only six instances of loss, in each case it was an internal intron.) The preference for internal introns may reflect a process of reverse transcription primed internally. Alternatively, there may be pressure to preferentially conserve introns near the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of genes. In particular, there is strong evidence for a functional role for the 5&#x02032;-most intron in many genes. What remains clear is that the pattern of loss in these fungi over the last 330 million years cannot be explained solely by a mechanism involving 3&#x02032;-end-primed reverse transcription of spliced messages. Instead, fungal intron dynamics appear to reflect a more complex interplay between intron gain and loss, an interplay that is likely to shape intron evolution in other eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Sequences and annotations</title><p>All sequences and annotations were taken from the Broad Institute Fungal Genome Initiative website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/fgi">http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/fgi</ext-link>).
