This is especially relevant for colon cancer, which represents the third leading cause of cancer mortality in developing countries and for which diagnostic tests and clinical treatments are not satisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Recently published reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] underline the growing role of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in preventing colon cancer. Epidemiologic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] have found that long-term users of aspirin or other NSAIDs have a lower risk of colorectal adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer compared to nonusers. Randomized clinical trials have confirmed that two NSAIDs, sulindac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, celecoxib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], effectively inhibit the growth of adenomatous polyps and cause regression of existing polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), although a recent study showed very clear benefits only for the first six months of treatment with sulindac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Despite a multiplicity of studies conducted on this compound family of drugs, little is known about the molecular targets that are responsible for their tumor-preventing properties and which are important, not only from a mechanistic point of view, but also because of their clinical implications in identifying individuals or subsets of patients who are sensitive to these drugs. Originally, it was believed that the regular use of these compounds acted exclusively through the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 activity involved in the production of prostaglandins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is now mounting evidence that the chemopreventive action of NSAIDs may involve COX-independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, despite initial enthusiasm about the potential relevance of NSAIDs, especially the selective COX-2 inhibitors, their use as chemopreventive or anticancer agents has been greatly limited by side-effects on gastrointestinal and renal systems.</p><p>In an attempt to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity, conventional NSAIDs have been coupled with a nitric oxide (NO)-releasing moiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The rationale for this approach is that NO compensates for the functions of prostaglandins, which are inhibited by conventional NSAIDs, in the gastrointestinal tract. Both prostaglandins and NO are capable of enhancing mucosal blood flow, mucus release and repair of mucosal injury in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and of reducing the severity of gastric injury in experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the activity of some NO-NSAIDs is considerably higher than that of the parental drugs. For example, NCX 4016 has been found to be much more effective than the parent aspirin in reducing aberrant crypt foci, a precancerous lesion, in a rat model of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and in inducing cell perturbations and growth inhibition in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similarly, Williams et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], in another panel of human colon cancer lines, reported a higher antiproliferative activity of NO-NSAID compounds compared to the parent aspirin.</p><p>In the present work, we compared the effect of a novel NO-releasing derivate, NCX 4040, with that of aspirin and its denitrated analog in <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>human colon cancer models and investigated the mechanisms of action underlying its antitumor activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>In vitro studies</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>The studies were performed on colon adenocarcinoma cell lines: 2 (LoVo and WiDr) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), 1 (LRWZ) was isolated in our laboratory and derived from a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of colon adenocarcinoma, and 1 was doxorubicin-resistant (LoVo Dx) derived from the above-mentioned LoVo cells.

Experiments were run in octuplet, and each experiment was repeated three times. The optical density of treated cells was determined at a wavelength of 540 nm by means of a fluorescence plate reader.

In particular, in LoVo cells caspase-3 and -9 activation was already evident after 3 h, whereas in LWRZ, activation took a longer time to occur (at least 10 h for caspase-9 and 12 h for caspase-3).

A difference in NCX 4040 sensitivity was also evident between the lines. Tumor regrowth was observed after 8 and 11 days for LoVo Dx and WiDr lines, respectively.

These findings suggest a pivotal role of the -NO<sub>2 </sub>group in the mechanism of action underlying its <italic>in vitro </italic>activity. Extensive evidence indicates that nitric oxide is capable of initiating apoptotic cell death in some cell types as a consequence of DNA-induced damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], but the pathways involved are still not fully understood. In the present study, it was seen that NCX 4040 induced apoptosis in two (LoVo and LRWZ) of the four cell lines investigated, albeit with a modulated activity. In particular, we observed early apoptosis in LoVo cells starting from a 6-h drug exposure, with a peak after 20 h, as shown by the TUNEL assay. We found that apoptotic death was induced by the concomitant activation of caspases-9 and -3 a few hours after NCX 4040 exposure.</p><p>In LRWZ cells, a relevant apoptosis was also observed but after a longer exposure time and at higher NCX 4040 concentrations, after which the irreversibly damaged cells underwent apoptotic death through the activation of caspases-9 and -3.</p><p>Moreover, two NO donors were used to better clarify the role of the aspirin component. These compounds, at concentrations similar to those utilized for NCX 4040, showed a very modest cytotoxic activity (data not shown), confirming the importance of the aspirin component for the antineoplastic effectiveness of the NCX 4040 molelcule.</p><p>In addition, WiDr and LoVo Dx cell lines, which proved to be resistant to NCX 4040-induced apoptosis, were characterized by baseline expression of COX-2 protein. This finding, which is consistent with data recently published for breast and colorectal cancer cells, would seem to support the hypothesis that a high level of COX-2 protein protects cells from apoptosis, especially that induced by NO-compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>With the exception of LRWZ, all the lines evaluated in <italic>in vitro </italic>studies showed a high tumorigenic capacity, making it possible to evaluate <italic>in vivo </italic>the antitumor efficacy of NCX 4040. The long-term administration of this drug was well tolerated by the mice and reduced the tumor mass of LoVo, LoVo Dx and WiDr lines compared to untreated mice. Analysis of growth curves highlighted differences in the degree of drug sensitivity between cell lines. NCX 4040 was very effective in delaying tumor growth in LoVo tumors, whereas WiDr, and especially LoVo Dx lines, regrew after the end of treatment. These results confirm the <italic>in vitro </italic>data and seem to indicate that, as observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, the ability of NCX 4040 to induce apoptosis has a key role in the antitumor efficacy of this drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, NCX 4040 was effective in reducing the growth of several human colon cancer cell lines both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas the parental compound aspirin showed no activity, which suggests that the NO-releasing derivate could prove useful in the clinical management of colon cancer, possibly in combination with conventional antineoplastic drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>COX, cyclooxygenase; NO, nitric oxide; NO-NSAID, nitric oxide-releasing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug releasing; NSAID, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug; SRB, sulforhodamine B; TUNEL, terminal uridine nick end labeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Manlio Bolla is an employee of NicOx SA.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AT was responsible for study design, data analysis, and drafting the manuscript.
