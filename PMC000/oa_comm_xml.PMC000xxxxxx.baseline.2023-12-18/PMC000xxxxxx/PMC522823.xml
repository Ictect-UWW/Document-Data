In Ghana, there have been more than 2000 reported cases in the last ten years; outbreaks have occurred in at least 90 of its 110 administrative districts. In one of the worst affected districts, Amansie West, there are arsenic-enriched surface environments resulting from the oxidation of arsenic-bearing minerals, occurring naturally in mineral deposits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Proximity analysis, carried out to determine spatial relationships between BU-affected areas and arsenic-enriched farmlands and arsenic-enriched drainage channels in the Amansie West District, showed that mean BU prevalence in settlements along arsenic-enriched drainages and within arsenic-enriched farmlands is greater than elsewhere. Furthermore, mean BU prevalence is greater along arsenic-enriched drainages than within arsenic-enriched farmlands.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results suggest that arsenic in the environment may play a contributory role in MU infection.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin disease, which usually begins as a painless nodule or papule and may progress to massive skin ulceration. If untreated BU may lead to extensive soft tissue destruction, with inflammation extending to deep fascia. The parts of the body most affected are the extremities. Subsequent complications may include contractural deformities. The main form of treatment is wide excisional surgery, including amputation of limbs, which requires prolonged hospitalization and is thus a significant burden on hospital resources and budgets.</p><p>In recent years, there has been increased incidence of BU in West Africa (including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Togo), Mexico, French Guyana, Papua New Guinea and Australia. The disease seems to affect mostly impoverished inhabitants in remote and rural areas; children are the most vulnerable, accounting for about 70% of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized BU as the third most prevalent mycobacterial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy and has called for urgent action to control it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The causative agent of BU is <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans </italic>(MU), which was first described in Bainsdale, Australia, in 1948 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. From the medical point of view, MU is among the group of mycobacteria that are potentially pathogenic in humans and animals under special circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is suggested MU enters through a small break or trauma in the skin because it is not known to penetrate through intact or healthy skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Portaels et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have suggested that insects may be involved in the transmission of the disease because insects found in the roots of trees tested positive with the mycobacterium. Marsolliers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] found through an experimental study that the bite of MU-infected waterborne insects transmitted infection to mice. In terms of human infection, however, the reservoir of MU and the mode of transmission of BU are still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Epidemiological data suggest that environmental factors such as climate, soil, geology, geochemistry, etc. may indirectly influence or contribute to MU infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, the frequencies of some diseases caused by mycobacteria indicate that species are distributed geographically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For example, MU has been observed mainly in the tropics and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] especially in anthropogenically-polluted areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Since MU is known to be present in nature although its reservoir is not known and since the epidemiology of BU is still unclear, there is a need to have a better understanding of environmental, ecological, and behavioural factors that predispose to infection. Spatial analysis potentially contributes important information leading to the understanding of the epidemiology and etiology of BU. The main objective of this paper is to explore relationships between some spatial environmental factors and the prevalence of BU.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>For the buffers tested, <italic>P </italic>values range from 0.09 to 0.46. The buffers with the highest <italic>P </italic>values (i.e., 0.09) are 100 m for drainage channels and 400 m for farmlands. With these buffers 24 of the 61 settlements (i.e., 39%) fall within 100 m of arsenic-enriched drainage channels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and 41 of the 61 settlements (i.e., 67%) fall within 400 m of As-enriched farmlands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The mean BU prevalence within the drainage buffer is 0.7% whereas the mean BU prevalence inside the farmland buffer is 0.6%. Thus the naturally smaller number of settlements within the drainage buffer (i.e., 24) has a slightly higher BU prevalence than the relatively larger number of settlements within the farmland buffer (i.e., 41).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Map of As-enriched farmlands. </bold>Distances to As-enriched farmlands (red; with &#x0003e; 15 ppm As in stream sediments) and locations of villages with BU cases.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-072X-3-19-4"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Map of As-enriched streams. </bold>Distances to As-enriched streams (black; with &#x0003e; 15 ppm As in stream sediments) and locations of villages with BU cases.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-072X-3-19-5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Siting of rural settlements in the study area is based primarily on proximity to and availability of water for drinking and other domestic purposes. Consequently, many settlements are located within the optimum buffer distance of 100 m from drainage channels. Where water is abstracted from drainage channels enriched in arsenic, chronic ingestion of arsenic-enriched water through drinking and cooking is likely. This renders the inhabitants susceptible to several kinds of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] including BU. Amofah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] studied 90 BU patients and found that 52 used surface water as the source of their drinking water. The result of the statistical analysis corroborates this observation in that BU prevalence is highest where the inhabitants have ready access to domestic water supplies from arsenic-enriched surface drainage.</p><p>Subsistence farmlands, especially those that depend partially on irrigation, tend to be located along stream floodplains. Soils in these floodplains have a high cation exchange capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] so that, where streams carry high concentration of arsenic, there is accumulation of arsenic in the soils of the floodplains. These high concentrations of arsenic are in part taken up by the foodcrops grown there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The results of the statistical analysis suggest that a high proportion of settlements with high BU prevalence exploit such floodplain farmlands enriched in arsenic.</p><p>Through consumption of arsenic-enriched drinking water and arsenic-enriched foodcrops, inhabitants in some settlements in the Amansie West District are prone to chronic ingestion of higher-than-average (but sub-toxic) levels of arsenic. Arsenic interacts with and inhibits several enzymes in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] leading to several multisystemic non-cancer effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which could predispose to defect the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Subjects exposed to high levels of arsenic concentrations were known to have impaired immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Immunosuppression due to arsenic has been found to defect antigen processing of splenic macrophages with consequent defective mechanism of helper T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Down-regulation of the immune system is known to be a risk factor for the development of BU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Several studies [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]] have reported of impaired resistance to viral/bacterial infection via arsenic ingestion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study reveal spatial dependency of BU prevalence upon proximity to drainage channels and farmlands containing &#x0003e; 15 ppm arsenic. Proximity implies chronic exposure to and/or ingestion of elevated concentrations of arsenic, which influences susceptibility to infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Research hypotheses</title><p>It has been consistently theorized that BU is acquired when MU enters the body through a skin rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, several people who were affected by the disease do not recall having any break or trauma in their skin prior to being infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A possible alternative is entry through non-ruptured but unusually unhealthy or thin skin.</p><p>Several dermatological diseases (e.g., Bowen's disease, hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation) are related to arsenic ingestion and exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Bioaccumulation of arsenic in the fatty tissues of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], due to its high lipid solubility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], may provide a favourable environment for MU in the skin because arsenic is known to help microorganisms grow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It can be hypothesized, therefore, that (a) arsenic induces MU adhesion to human tissues and (b) arsenic influences the ability of MU to establish BU.</p><p>In a case study, Amofah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that about 44% of the BU patients were farmers whilst about 54% were school children. In Ghana many children help their parents on farms. Not only do farmers and children come in contact with natural drainage areas on their journeys to and from their farmlands, but also the farms are located near water bodies or drainage systems for obvious irrigation purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. If farmlands and surface drainage channels are contributory factors to BU, farmlands and surface drainage channels enriched in arsenic may contribute to still higher prevalence of BU.</p></sec><sec><title>Research methodology</title><p>Spatial analysis of data provides opportunities for epidemiologists to study associations between environmental factors and spatial distribution of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A geographic information system (GIS) is capable of analyzing and integrating large quantities of geographically distributed data as well as linking geographic data to non-geographic data to generate information useful in further scientific (or medical) research and in decision-making.</p><p>In this study, topographic map data, stream sediment geochemical data for arsenic, ASTER satellite imagery and locations of settlements with BU cases were the basic data inputs into the GIS. Spatial data processing was carried out (a) to delineate arsenic-enriched catchment basins based on arsenic concentrations in stream sediment samples, (b) to delineate farmlands from ASTER satellite imagery and determine arsenic-enriched farmlands based on catchment basin data and (c) to extract drainage channels from the topographic map and determine arsenic-enriched drainage channels based on arsenic-enriched catchment basins. Proximity analysis was undertaken to determine spatial relationships between BU-affected areas and the arsenic-enriched areas determined from the data inputs.</p></sec><sec><title>The study area</title><sec><title>History of BU in Ghana</title><p>The study area is in Ghana, where the first case of BU was reported in 1971 and, between 1991 and 1997, more than 2000 cases have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The disease has affected all of the ten regions and at least 90 of the 110 districts in Ghana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The Ashanti Region is the worst affected, accounting for about 60% of all reported cases, of which the greatest percentage is in the Amansie West District (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The study area. </bold>Amansie West District, Ghana, showing the study area (box) and villages with BU cases (black dots).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-072X-3-19-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Location of study area</title><p>The Amansie West District lies between latitudes 6&#x000b0;N and 6&#x000b0;45'N and longitudes 1&#x000b0;30'W and 2&#x000b0;15'W. It covers an area of about 1,136 km<sup>2</sup>. The district capital, Manso Nkwanta, is about 40 km south of Kumasi. The district is drained by the Offin and Oda rivers. Vegetation in the district is composed mainly of secondary forests, thicket, forb regrowth (i.e., soft-stemmed leafy herbs, mostly the weeds, which appear on farms and have to be cut regularly) and swamp vegetation. Vegetation thrives in ferric fluvisols, which are the major soil types in the district. These soils have been developed through yearly rainfall ranging from 125 to 200 cm with temperatures of 22 to 30&#x000b0;C. The landscape of the district varies from gentle to broken.</p><p>The district is underlain by Lower Proterozoic Birimian and, to a lesser extent, Tarkwaian rocks. Throughout Ghana, Birimian rocks of West Africa are mainly volcanic greenstones with intervening sedimentary rocks and granitoid intrusions, in places containing deposits composed of pyrite, arsenopyrite, minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, native gold and secondary hematite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The district has about 310 settlements (though not all these settlements are mapped) with a population in 2000 of 108,726. There are approximately equal percentages of males and females (49% and 51%, respectively), of whom 70% are farmers and 22% are engaged in legal and 'galamsey' (or illegal) mining.</p><p>The study area is the east-central part of the Amansie West District (covered by a single topographic map sheet, 0602C1), with an area of about 623 km<sup>2</sup>, comprising 61 settlements and including the Bilpraw goldmine (formerly a treasure mine of the Ashanti Kings).

From the scanned map, spatial data were captured by screen digitizing. From the topographic map, rivers, streams and gullies were digitised as line segments as were elevation contours. The boundaries of the district were digitised as line segments and then polygonized. The locations of centres of 61 settlements (identifiable on the topographic map) were digitised as points and the BU incidence in 1999 was recorded as spatial attribute of each settlement.</p><p>From the stream sediment sample location map, the locations of the samples were digitised as points and the arsenic concentrations (in ppm) were recorded as a spatial attribute of each sample. The ASTER imagery was also georeferenced to the same coordinate system using eight reference points (tie points), which were selected in the image and which could be identified in the topographic map. Using an affine transformation, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.58 pixel was obtained in georeferencing the ASTER imagery.</p><p>For each of the settlements with incidence of BU the percentage prevalence of BU was calculated. Prevalence expresses cases of a disease in terms of the proportion of the population afflicted at a specified time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

The data are lognormally distributed and, after removing obvious outliers in the data, a geometric mean of 8.9 ppm As and standard deviation of 2.8 ppm As were obtained. The threshold value was therefore set at 15 ppm As (i.e., approximately the mean plus two standard deviations). The spatial distribution of arsenic was then mapped through the generation of a catchment basin anomaly map in which a sample catchment basin is assigned the geochemical attribute of the corresponding sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].
