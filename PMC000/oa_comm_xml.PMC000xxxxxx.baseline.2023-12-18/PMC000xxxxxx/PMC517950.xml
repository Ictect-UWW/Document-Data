Its expression is elevated in prostate carcinoma, particularly in metastatic and recurrent lesions. These observations suggest that PSMA can be used as immune target to induce tumor cell-specific recognition by the host and, consequently tumor rejection. We utilized a DNA-based vaccine to specifically enhance PSMA expression. An immune modulator, such as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides which promote Th1-type immune responses was combined to increase the efficacy of tumor recognition and elimination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A eukaryotic expression plasmid pCDNA3.1-<italic>PSMA </italic>encoding full-length PSMA was constructed. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with endotoxin-free pCDNA3.1-<italic>PSMA </italic>alone or in combination with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides by intramuscular injection. After 4 immunizations, PSMA specific antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocyte reactivity were measured. Immunized C57BL/6 mice were also challenged subcutaneously with B16 cells transfected with PSMA to evaluate suppression of tumor growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Vaccine-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with B16 cells expressing PSMA could be induced with this treatment schedule. Immune protection was observed in vaccinated mice as indicated by increased tumor growth in the control group (100%) compared with the groups vaccinated with DNA alone (66.7%) or DNA plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (50%) respectively. Average tumor volume was smaller in vaccinated groups and tumor-free survival time was prolonged by the vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current findings suggest that specific anti-tumor immune response can be induced by DNA vaccines expressing PSMA. In addition, the suppression of in vivo growth of tumor cells expressing PSMA was augmented by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. This strategy may provide a new venue for the treatment of carcinoma of prostate after failure of standard therapy.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Carcinoma of prostate is the most common cancer in males in America, ranking as the second most common leading cause of cancer-related deaths, just after carcinoma of the lung. In addition, the incidence and mortality of carcinoma of prostate are increasing in China. Although surgery and radiation therapy remain the primary choice for localized stage of carcinoma of prostate, there is no effective treatment for patients who develop recurrences or those who have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new types of treatment.</p><p>Strategies that stimulate the ability of the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells via selective killing mechanisms have shown promise in the treatment of cancer. DNA vaccines offer several potential advantages for the immunotherapy of cancer. Proteins encoded by DNA vaccines are expressed in the cytoplasm and presented through the endogenous processing pathway associated with MHC Class I molecules, thereafter leading to the activation of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which act as effectors in the anti-tumor immune response. DNA vaccines are cost-effective since DNA is relatively simple to purify in a large quantities. Another intrinsic advantage consists in the presence in the plasmid itself of un-methylated CpG motifs (immunostimulatory sequences) that may act as a potent immunological adjuvant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, there is a good rationale for further development of DNA vaccines to immunize against antigens present on cancer cells.</p><p>Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a well-established prostate specific tumor associated antigen (TAA), is 100 kD type II transmembrane glucoprotein. It is predominantly expressed in the prostate gland, minimal levels of expression in brain tissue, jejunum and proximal kidney tubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Its expression is significantly elevated in carcinoma of prostate, particularly in metastastic disease and recurrent disease after hormone therapy fails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These properties of PSMA propose it as an ideal target of anti-cancer vaccines.</p><p>A number of strategies are under evaluation to enhance the potency of DNA vaccines, some of which involves broad stimulation of the immune system using immunomodulatory agents. Synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides have immunological effects similar to those seen with bacterial DNA and represent promising vaccine adjuvants, which promote T helper1 (Th1)-type immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Unmethylated CpG motifs are present at a much higher frequency in the genome of prokaryotes than eukaryotes. The release of unmethylated CpG DNA during an infection provides a 'danger signal' to the innate immune system, triggering a protective immune response that improves the ability of the host to eliminate the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides up-taken by B cells and plasmacytoid dentritic cells (pDCs), which express Toll-like receptror 9 (TLR9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] initiate an immune stimulatory cascade that culminates in the indirect maturation, differentiation and proliferation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Together, these cells secrete cytokines and chemokines that create a pro-inflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;) and Th1-polarized (interferon-&#x003b3;, and IL-12) immune <italic>milieu </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which further facilitates the development of antigen-specific CTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These effects indicate that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides could act as vaccine adjuvant. The present study was designed to test the therapeutic efficacy of a PSMA-based DNA vaccine in a mouse model of tumor cell implants expressing PSMA. In addition, the adjuvant role of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides to augment the potency of the constructed DNA vaccine was tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and Cell lines</title><p>C57BL/6 mice (H-2b) were bred and kept under pathogen-free conditions.

CTL reactivity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release using a Cytotox 96 assay kit (Promega). Controls were setup on each plate for spontaneous LDH release by target and effector cells. A parallel experiment using B16 cells transfected with pCDNA3.1 as target cells was also performed to test the specificity of lysis. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

New approaches are required to treat this incurable disease. DNA vaccination enables maintenance of tumor antigen expression at the vaccination site and results in immune responses in the host, therefore, shedding light on the treatment of cancer. It has been reported that tumor growth is suppressed when tumor cells are implanted in mice previously immunized with DNA vaccines encoding tumor antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>PSMA is a well-defined prostate-restricted tumor associated antigen whose expression is significantly elevated in carcinoma of prostate, especially in advanced stages. The expression of PSMA is down-regulated by androgen, after androgen deprivation therapy, its expression is strongly elevated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], Thus, PSMA is a potential target for the immunotherapy to carcinoma of prostate. Several PSMA-based vaccines had been developed and it has been observed in a phase II trial utilizing MHC Class I-restricted peptides that PSMA can induce immune responses in patients with advanced carcinoma of prostate and alleviate the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This observation suggests PSMA as an appropriate target of active-specific immunization against carcinoma of prostate. However, standard methods of protein/epitope preparations often coupled to the adoptive transfer of antigen presenting cells are labor-intensive decreasing the widespread use of vaccines in the general cancer patient population.</p><p>The purpose of our work was to delineate new ways to induce immune responses by DNA vaccination. In this study, all mice immunized with DNA vaccine expressing PSMA generated PSMA specific antibodies at a low level, which may result from the small amount of antigen expressed by plasmid in vivo. What is noteworthy is that all immunized mice developed CTL reactivity to B16-PSMA which led to suppression of tumor growth. In addition, although some tumors developed in some treated mice, they were consistently smaller in the control group. These findings suggest that DNA vaccines expressing PSMA could elicit immune response against tumor cells expressing the target molecule.</p><p>Although DNA vaccines provide a convenient and effective approach to elicit cellular immunity, clinical outcomes have not been satisfactory, mainly because tumor-specific CTL elicited by the vaccines are insufficient to suppress cancer progression. CD8+ CTLs constitute one of the most important arms of the immune system, exhibiting the capacity of recognizing and destroying cancerous cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A variety of approaches are under evaluation to activate CD8+ CTLs, to that end, vaccines need to be administered in combination with adjuvants of which the most commonly used in experimental models is incomplete Freud's adjuvant (IFA). However, this adjuvant is not widely used in human vaccination protocols due to its undesirable side effects, such as erythema and induration at the injection site, in addition, IFA functions mainly to promote humoral immunity. For these reasons, alternative potent and safe adjuvants need to be identified to enhance cellular immune response against cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides represent a promising adjuvant. The predominant effect of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides exposure is the promotion of Th1-type immune responses. Professional antigen presenting uptake CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and become activated with increased expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] that promote antigen presentation to na&#x000ef;ve T cells. In addition, dentritic cells are stimulated to secret Th1-biased cytokines, such as interferon-&#x003b3; and IL-12 particularly desirable in cancer immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides may be useful vaccine adjuvants.</p><p>CpG oligodeoxynucleotides 1826 is a potent enhancer of Th1-type immune responses and may benefit anti-cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We, therefore, hypothesized that the administration of these CpG oligodeoxynucleotides should enhance the cellular immunity elicited by DNA vaccines. However, co-adminstration of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and DNA vaccines inhibit each other activity because CpG oligodeoxynucleotides may compete with plasmid uptake by antigen presenting cells. Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b3;induced by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides could inhibit the activity of the CMV promoter utilized by eukaryotic expression vector, thus decreasing antigen expression. To examine the efficacy of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides as vaccine adjuvants, we injected them at the DNA injection site 3 days after vaccination rather than simultaneously. This strategy was based on a previous observation that transfected cells reach maximum yield of antigen expression between day 2 and 3 after vaccination. In this context, delivering the CpG oligodeoxynucleotides at the time of maximal antigen expression may be crucial to optimize the immunogenic boost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with previous reports, this study suggests that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides enhance cellular immunity. The activity of CTL against PSMA expressing cells in the CpG +DNA vaccination group was significantly higher than in the DNA vaccination group. Furthermore, tumor challenge experiments demonstrated a potentiation of the suppressive effects on the growth of tumor cells expressing PSMA. These findings indicate that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides should be a powerful adjuvant in the context of DNA-based vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we designed a DNA vaccine expressing prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and utilized CpG oligodeoxynucleotides to promote Th1-type immune response. We discovered that the constructed vaccine generated anti-tumor reactivity against malignant cells expressing PSMA that was enhanced by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides co-administration. This strategy may provide a new venue for the treatment of carcinoma of prostate, particularly for recurrent disease after hormone therapy fails.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>R.J.Q participated in the design of the study and carried out plasmid DNA transfection, RT-PCR, immunofluorescence assay, DNA vaccination, lymphocyte stimulations, cytotoxicity assays, and completed the preparation of the manuscript.
