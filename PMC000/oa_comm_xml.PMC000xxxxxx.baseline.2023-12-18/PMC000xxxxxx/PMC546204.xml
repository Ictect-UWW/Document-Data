A maximum in median eminence 5HT concentration occurred at 21:00 h whereas adenohypophysial 5HT peaked at 13:00 h. Median eminence 5HT concentration and circulating prolactin correlated inversely. In the median eminence, GABA concentration attained maximal values at 21:00 h, whereas it reached a maximum at 13:00 h in the pituitary gland. Median eminence GABA concentration correlated inversely with circulating prolactin. In the median eminence, taurine values varied in a bimodal way showing two maxima, at the second half of the rest span and of the activity phase, respectively. In the adenohypophysis, minimal taurine levels coincided with the major plasma prolactin peak (at 01:00 h).

Two major regulatory inhibitory inputs for prolactin secretion are dopamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, many other neuromodulators have been implicated in the control of prolactin secretion, among them, vasoactive intestinal peptide, thyrotropin releasing hormone and serotonin (5HT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. More recently, taurine has also been implicated in the regulation of prolactin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that basal secretion of prolactin varies throughout the day, describing a characteristic pattern with maximal values close to the light-dark transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Such a circadian pattern has been described not only in rodents (rat and mouse) but also in many other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the rat, we previously demonstrated changes of the secretory pattern of prolactin along the year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], as well as a function of aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The rat is very immature at birth, so that newborn and suckling rats are very sensitive to manipulations that can affect adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Circadian rhythms of developing mammals seem to be entrained by the rhythmicity of their mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and several studies have indicated that maternal melatonin is necessary to entrain the circadian rhythms in the newborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The rabbit is probably the best-studied laboratory animal in the wild, due to its abundance, size and importance as an agricultural pest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Wild and laboratory rabbits are essentially nocturnal and display a clear daily pattern of activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The rabbit possesses a number of behavioral specializations that make it uniquely suited for circadian studies. Female rabbits visit their altricial young only for a few minutes once every 24 h to nurse, and survival of the young depends on the tight circadian-controlled synchronization in behavior and physiology with the mother. This unusual pattern of maternal care and the demands it places on the litter provide an excellent opportunity to analyze circadian rhythms during early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to the large amount of information available on circadian rhythms in adult mammals, studies on circadian phenomena in neonates are few [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. For example, in 21 day-old male rats the daily circadian pattern of prolactin secretion seen in adults is absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Considering that no information on circadian rhythmicity of prolactin secretion in neonatal male rabbits is available, we undertook the present study to analyze whether neonatal male rabbits show defined 24-h changes in plasma prolactin levels and whether neonatal male rabbits show circadian changes in DA, 5HT, GABA and taurine concentration in median eminence and the adenohypophysis, all of which are well known modulators of prolactin secretion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>This study was performed using 24 multiparous, lactating Californian &#x000d7; New Zealand White crossbreed doe rabbits. Animals were housed in research facilities of the Animal Production Department. They were maintained under controlled light-dark cycles (LD 16:8, light on at 08:00 h), housed in individual metal cages, fed at libitum using a commercial pellet diet (Lab Rabbit Chow, Purina Mills, Torrej&#x000f3;n de Ardoz, Madrid, Spain) with free access to tap water. On day 1 after parturition, litter size was standardized to 8&#x02013;9 by adding or removing kits to assure similar lactation conditions during the experiment. This study was performed according to the CEE Council Directive (86/609, 1986) for the care of experimental animals. Groups of 6&#x02013;7 suckling male rabbits were killed by decapitation on day 11 of life at six different time points throughout a 24-hour cycle. The brains were quickly removed, and the median eminence and the anterior pituitary were taken out. Anterior pituitaries were weighed and homogenized in chilled (0&#x02013;1&#x000b0;C) 2 M acetic acid. After centrifugation (at 15000 &#x000d7; g for 30 min, at 5&#x000b0;C), the samples were either analyzed for DA and 5HT or boiled for 10 min and further centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 20 min to measure GABA and taurine.</p></sec><sec><title>Hormone assay</title><p>Plasma prolactin levels were measured by a specific homologous RIA method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] using AFP-991086 antibody supplied by the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and Dr. A. F. Parlow (Harbour-UCLA Medical Center, CA, USA). The titer of antibody used was 1:62,500. The PRL standard used was RbPR<sub>L</sub>-RP-1. Hormone was labeled with <sup>125</sup>I by the chloroamine-T method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The volume of plasma for PRL determinations was 10 &#x003bc;l. <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(prepared by the Department of Plant Physiology, U.A.M., Madrid, Spain) was used to precipitate the bound fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. All samples were measured in the same assay run to avoid inter-assay variations. The sensitivity of the assay for PRL was 0.125 ng/ml and the intra-assay coefficient of variation was &#x0003c; 5%. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was calculated using a pool of plasma measured ten times in the same assay; mean (&#x000b1; S.E.M.) concentration was 106.9 &#x000b1; 4.1 ng/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Catecholamine and indoleamine analysis</title><p>DA and 5HT concentration was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using electrochemical detection (Coulochem, 5100A, ESA; USA), as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A C-18 reverse phase column eluted with a mobile phase (pH 4. 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M citric acid, 0.7 mM sodium octylsulphate and 0.57 mM EDTA containing 10% methanol, v/v) was employed. Flow rate was 1 ml/min, at a pressure of 2200 psi. Fixed potentials against H<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+ </sup>reference electrode were: conditioning electrode: -0.4 V; preoxidation electrode: +0.10; working electrode: +0.35 V. Indoleamine and catecholamine concentration was calculated from the chromatographic peak heights by using external standards and was expressed as pg/&#x003bc;g protein. The linearity of the detector response for DA and 5HT was tested within the concentration ranges found in median eminence and adenohypophysial supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Amino acid analysis</title><p>Amino acids were isolated and analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detection after precolumn derivatization with O-phthalaldehyde (OPA) as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. An aliquot of the tissue supernatant containing homoserine as an internal standard was neutralized with 4 M NaOH and was then incubated at room temperature with OPA reagent (4 mM OPA, 10% methanol, 2.56 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, in 1.6 M potassium borate buffer, pH 9.5) for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by adding acetic acid (0.5 % v/v). Samples were immediately loaded through a Rheodyne (Model 7125) injector system (50 &#x003bc;l loop) to reach a C-18 reverse-phase column (4.6 mm ID &#x000d7; 150 mm, Nucleosil 5, 100A). Elution was achieved by means of a mobile phase consisting of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 35 % methanol, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a pressure of 140 Bars. The column was subsequently washed with the same buffer containing 70 % methanol and re-equilibrated with the elution buffer before re-use. The filter fluorometer was set at the following wavelengths: excitation: 340 nm, emission: 455 nm. The procedure allowed a distinct separation and resolution of the amino acids measured. Amino acid content was calculated from the chromatographic peak heights by using standard curves and the internal standard. The linearity of the detector response was tested within the concentration ranges found in median eminence and adenohypophysial extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis of results was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Tukey-Kramer's multiple comparisons tests. Curve estimation in regression analysis was made by using SPSS software, version 10.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, ILL). P values lower than 0.05 were considered evidence for statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the levels of prolactin throughout the day in suckling male pups.

In concomitant measurements of median eminence and adenohypophysial concentration of DA, 5HT, GABA and taurine, a clear daily pattern was found in almost every case. Contrasting with neonatal rats that did not display any circadian pattern of plasma prolactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a daily rhythm of plasma prolactin occurred in neonatal male rabbits, with a maximal value attained 1 h after lights-off (at 01:00 h) and a secondary peak found during the first part of the resting phase (at 13:00 h).</p><p>In adult rabbits, daily patterns of prolactin secretion depend on light/dark phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The present results indicate that, already on day 11 of life, male rabbit pups display daily changes in plasma prolactin levels, remarkably similar to those described in adult male rats (e.g., the maximum displayed 1 h after the dark onset) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The activity of several nuclei of rabbit hypothalamus increases with age and with experience of anticipatory arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Considering that DA is the major inhibitory input for prolactin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the present study indicating that DA concentration in median eminence of rabbit pups is high during the rest phase of the day (when plasma prolactin levels are low), and decreases at day-night transition (coinciding with the increase in circulating prolactin), may support a cause-effect relationship. The afternoon decrease in median eminence DA concentration could be a prerequisite for prolactin release in neonatal male rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, median eminence DA concentration of male rabbit pups also presents a peak during the activity phase (01:00 h) associated with the highest prolactin levels. Therefore, the data suggest that the inhibitory regulatory influence of DA on prolactin secretion is exerted mainly during the light phase of the photoperiod, whereas during the dark phase other hypothalamic neuromodulators could be operative, as it was previously described in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These hypotheses must be tested rigorously (e.g., by using pharmacological blocking agents) before a definitive conclusion can be made.</p><p>Among other possible neuromodulators of prolactin secretion, the arcuate nucleus receives a dense serotonergic innervation consisting of a population of brainstem neurons arising mainly from the midbrain raphe nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and from fibers originated in 5HT cell bodies located within the hypothalamus. There is a close proximity of 5HT fibers to dopaminergic cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, an indirect effect of 5HT on prolactin release could be linked to the modulation of the inhibitory dopaminergic inputs to the pituitary. Our foregoing results agree with this hypothesis since 5HT concentration in median eminence changes diurnally in an opposite way to that of plasma prolactin levels, albeit without a significant correlation between them. Indeed, previous experiments in rats indicated that 5HT could probably modulate directly the secretion of prolactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Taurine has also been implicated in the regulation of prolactin release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The foregoing results indicate that in median eminence and anterior pituitary of male rabbit pups taurine concentration varies inversely to plasma prolactin levels, displaying a mirror pattern. In the adenohypophysis a negative correlation between plasma prolactin and taurine levels was found, similarly to previous data obtained in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, taurine may play a role in prolactin regulation in newborn rabbits.</p><p>A relatively dense innervation of GABA terminals exists in the external layer of the median eminence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and the ability of median eminence neurons to release GABA in portal blood has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We previously demonstrated a possibly inhibitory control of GABA on prolactin secretion during the activity phase in male rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Results obtained in the present study in suckling male rabbits support such an inhibitory effect of GABA on plasma prolactin levels exerted mainly during the dark phase of daily photoperiod. The data indicate that GABA concentration in median eminence decreased during the day-night transition, while plasma prolactin levels were increasing. Actually, in median eminence a negative correlation between GABA concentration and plasma prolactin was found, thus suggesting an inhibitory effect of GABA on prolactin secretion.</p><p>GABA acting on specific receptors in the anterior pituitary has been reported to suppress prolactin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], although whether this effect was physiological has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Data from literature suggest that the role of GABA on prolactin release is quite complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In some conditions, such as aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or hyperprolactinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the inhibitory role of GABA becomes more pronounced whereas the inhibitory control exerted by DA diminishes. Our results in male rabbit pups indicated that, although no correlation between plasma prolactin and pituitary GABA concentration was found, the pattern may confirm the main role of this amino acid in the control of prolactin secretion during the dark phase of the photoperiod that was developed later. Again, all these hypotheses must be tested. e.g. pharmacologically, before a definitive conclusion on this matter can be drawn.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In suckling male rabbits plasma prolactin and median eminence and anterior pituitary concentration of several neuromodulators change on a daily basis. The existence of significant correlations among several of the neurotransmitters analyzed and plasma prolactin levels may explain the circadian secretory pattern of prolactin at this age in suckling rabbits. Collectively, the present results differ from the reported absence of circadian rhythmicity of prolactin and median eminence and adenohypophysial neuromodulators in rats at a comparable age.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>MPA and PC carried out the experiment and the immunoassays and the analysis of catecholamines, indoleamines and amino acids.
