<article-title>How Bacteria Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love...Formaldehyde</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Genome-scale analysis of predicted metabolic pathways has revealed the common occurrence of apparent redundancy for specific functional units, or metabolic modules. In many cases, mutation analysis does not resolve function, and instead, direct experimental analysis of metabolic flux under changing conditions is necessary. In order to use genome sequences to build models of cellular function, it is important to define function for such apparently redundant systems. Here we describe direct flux measurements to determine the role of redundancy in three modules involved in formaldehyde assimilation and dissimilation in a bacterium growing on methanol. A combination of deuterium and <sup>14</sup>C labeling was used to measure the flux through each of the branches of metabolism for growth on methanol during transitions into and out of methylotrophy. The cells were found to differentially partition formaldehyde among the three modules depending on the flux of methanol into the cell. A dynamic mathematical model demonstrated that the kinetic constants of the enzymes involved are sufficient to account for this phenomenon. We demonstrate the role of redundancy in formaldehyde metabolism and have uncovered a new paradigm for coping with toxic, high-flux metabolic intermediates: a dynamic, interconnected metabolic loop.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>By feeding bacteria methanol labeled with deuterium, the relative contributions of two distinct pathways of formaldehyde metabolism have been demonstrated</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The availability of large numbers of genome sequences has facilitated metabolic reconstruction based on predicted gene function, in essence, a prediction of the metabolic blueprint of a cell.

However, a major difficulty with this approach is the common occurrence of apparently redundant functional modules. It is often not possible to assign roles to these metabolic segments, which have been referred to as the &#x0201c;gray areas of the genome&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Expression profiling, either of transcripts or proteins, holds the promise to gain more insight into the function of redundant metabolic modules, but the presence of a transcript or protein does not necessarily correlate with module function, due to posttranslational effects on metabolic flux. In order to determine the true function of such metabolic modules, it is necessary to measure the flux of metabolites through each functional module during relevant physiological changes.</p><p>One system that has proved amenable to a modular approach to metabolism is the ability to grow on one-carbon (C<sub>1</sub>) compounds, or methylotrophy [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The availability of a gapped genome sequence for a model methylotrophic bacterium, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methylobacterium extorquens</named-content> AM1, has accelerated the definition of methylotrophy modules, and a reasonably complete metabolic reconstruction is available for this bacterium [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, these analyses coupled to genetic and physiological studies [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have raised a series of fundamental questions that can only be answered through direct flux measurements.</p><p>As in other such aerobic methylotrophic bacteria, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. extorquens</named-content> AM1 oxidizes C<sub>1</sub> substrates to formaldehyde and is essentially growing on formaldehyde for both carbon and energy metabolism [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is not yet understood how the toxic central metabolite formaldehyde is efficiently and dynamically partitioned between assimilatory and dissimilatory metabolism, without toxic buildup. Therefore, this system represents both a key problem of methylotrophy and a paradigm for how toxic metabolites are managed in high-flux conditions. Genomic predictions and mutant analyses have identified three functional modules that direct formaldehyde into two outputs: assimilatory or dissimilatory metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The first module consists of the apparently nonenzymatic condensation reaction between formaldehyde and tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>F) [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to generate methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F directly, which is the C<sub>1</sub> donor for assimilation via the serine cycle. The second module is initiated by an enzyme-catalyzed reaction [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] of formaldehyde with a folate compound found in methanogenic Archaea, tetrahydromethanopterin (H<sub>4</sub>MPT). The resulting methylene-H<sub>4</sub>MPT is subsequently oxidized through a series of reactions to formate [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which can ultimately be dissimilated to CO<sub>2</sub> via the activity of multiple formate dehydrogenases [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Finally, a third module involves interconversion of methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F and formate via a familiar set of H<sub>4</sub>F-dependent reactions found in most organisms [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

It was suggested over 20 y ago that the H<sub>4</sub>F module functions in formaldehyde oxidation [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This predicts that the H<sub>4</sub>MPT and H<sub>4</sub>F modules are parallel, redundant formaldehyde oxidation systems. Recent genetic and biochemical evidence [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], however, suggest that the H<sub>4</sub>F module is not functionally redundant to the H<sub>4</sub>MPT module for formaldehyde oxidation. An alternative hypothesis suggests that the H<sub>4</sub>F module functions in the reductive direction, generating methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F from formate [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This model suggests a single dissimilatory module (H<sub>4</sub>MPT module) and two, redundant assimilatory modules: the H<sub>4</sub>F module and the direct condensation of methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F from formaldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g001">Figure 1</xref>, green arrows). This model predicts two routes for generating the key assimilatory intermediate methylene H<sub>4</sub>F from formaldehyde: one we will term &#x0201c;direct,&#x0201d; involving the direct condensation step, and one we will term &#x0201c;long,&#x0201d; involving the consecutive action of the H<sub>4</sub>MPT and H<sub>4</sub>F modules. Although the direct route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g001">Figure 1</xref>, green arrows) requires flux through a nonenzymatic reaction, assimilation via the proposed long route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g001">Figure 1</xref>, blue arrows) involving the action of the H<sub>4</sub>MPT and H<sub>4</sub>F modules is energetically costly due to a net expenditure of one ATP per C<sub>1</sub> unit. If this hypothesis is correct, the H<sub>4</sub>MPT module would play a role in both dissimilatory and assimilatory metabolism, in much the same way that the tricarboxylic acid cycle plays a dual role in growth on multicarbon compounds.</p><p>Clearly, this is an example in which metabolic reconstruction is not sufficient to predict the roles of the central metabolic modules involved in carbon partitioning. In addition, it provides a test case for how cells cope with a high-flux toxic metabolic intermediate. In order to address this problem, we have used a combination of stable isotope- and radioisotope-labeling approaches, which has allowed the complete determination of flux through every branch of methylotrophy. The results provide a dynamic picture of the response of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. extorquens</named-content> AM1 during transitions in and out of methylotrophy. Furthermore, a kinetic model of the key formaldehyde utilization systems was developed that successfully predicted key system dynamics. Our data resolve the specific roles for three interconnected metabolic modules that have two cellular outputs, assimilation and dissimilation. Furthermore, we have revealed a new paradigm for handling high-flux toxic intermediates: a dynamic metabolic loop that demonstrates graded response to changing metabolic needs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Detection of Serine-Derived Mass Fragments Using Gas Chromatography&#x02013;Mass Spectrometry</title><p>A CD<sub>3</sub>OD label tracing strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g002">Figure 2</xref>) was devised to directly determine what fraction of the methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F that entered the serine cycle was formed from the direct condensation of formaldehyde and H<sub>4</sub>F (direct route), versus the fraction formed through the alternative potential route involving oxidation of formaldehyde to formate by the H<sub>4</sub>MPT module, followed by assimilation through the H<sub>4</sub>F module (long route). The serine that is produced from methanol contains the carbon atom, and both hydrogens, from the methylene group of the methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F donor. Serine produced from CD<sub>3</sub>OD via the direct route contains two D, while that produced via the long route contains one D and in both cases these are relatively nonexchangeable C-D bonds. Therefore, at short labeling times (&#x0003c;1 min) the ratio of serine isotopomers with one or two D is an assay of the ratio of flux through the two routes.</p><fig id="pbio-0030016-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>GC&#x02013;MS Method to Assay Ratio of Long Versus Direct Routes</title><p>(A) Simplified model of formaldehyde metabolism highlighting the deuterium (in red) label-tracing strategy.

Consistent with a derivatized serine standard and previous work [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], a peak was observed at approximately 8.6 min that contained two major ions with M/z of 156 and 228 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g002">2</xref>C).

Analysis of the derivatized H<sub>2</sub>O-soluble small molecule preparation from wild-type samples indicated a substantial increase in the proportion of fragments present as (+1) and (+2) isotopomers (&#x0003e;35% of total serine isotopomers). CD<sub>3</sub>OD labeling with a <italic>glyA</italic> mutant strain (CM239K.1), which lacks the initial serine-cycle enzyme, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and was therefore completely unable to assimilate carbon from formaldehyde, produced no increase in (+1) or (+2) isotopomers (data not shown). Additionally, mutants defective for the proposed long route for methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F formation were tested for deuterium labeling. These included the <italic>ftfL</italic> (encodes formate-H<sub>4</sub>F ligase) mutant CM216K.1 [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], blocked for the H<sub>4</sub>F module, and the <italic>dmrA</italic> (encodes dihydromethanopterin reductase) mutant CM212K.1 [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which has been shown to lack H<sub>4</sub>MPT [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Consistent with their proposed roles, the proportion of (+1) fragments dropped 8-fold for these mutants, compared to a modest 2-fold decrease in (+2) fragments. These data indicate that both the H<sub>4</sub>F and H<sub>4</sub>MPT modules affect labeling of serine and are required to generate the large increase in (+1) isotopomers seen with wild-type. These data also indicate that potential exchange reactions that could eliminate the deuteriums do not contribute measurably to the presence of (+1) ions. Collectively, these data indicate that the (+1) and (+2) serine mass fragments can serve as an accurate proxy for methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F generated through the long or direct routes. One caveat to this statement is that a portion of the NADPH involved in generating methylene H<sub>4</sub>MPT could be derived from the oxidation of methylene H<sub>4</sub>MPT to methenyl H<sub>4</sub>MPT and, therefore, could have become deuterium labeled. Based on the stoichiometry of the reactions and the known activity ratio of NADPH- versus NADH-producing enzymes for the methylene-H<sub>4</sub>MPT dehydrogenase reaction, we calculated that we at most overestimate the contribution of the direct pathway by 25% during growth on methanol, and by significantly smaller values at times with lower formaldehyde production. This prediction assumes an infinitely small intracellular concentration of NADPH, so depending on the actual pool of NADPH present, the error will be less. Therefore, our results are presented as maximum ratio changes.</p><p>When labeled with CD<sub>3</sub>OD, the succinate-grown wild-type cultures utilized to verify the GC&#x02013;MS method produced a ratio of (+1) versus (+2) serine mass fragments of 8.0 &#x000b1; 0.6. Thus, when succinate-grown cells are first exposed to methanol, the majority of methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F assimilated via the serine cycle is generated via the proposed long route. In contrast, CD<sub>3</sub>OD labeling of mid-exponential-phase methanol-grown cells indicated that the direct route dominated by up to 15-fold (measured ratio of [+1]/[+2] of 0.065 &#x000b1; 0.006). Therefore, although both methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F production routes operated under both physiological conditions, a significant shift in the ratio of the two routes occurred, up to 100-fold.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Relative Contributions of the Long and Direct Routes of Methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F Formation during Transitions to and from Methylotrophic Growth</title><p>In order to understand the dynamics of the contribution of the long and direct routes for directing C<sub>1</sub> units into assimilatory metabolism during transitions to and from methylotrophic growth, metabolic shift experiments were performed.

Of formate made from the H<sub>4</sub>MPT module (flux B), most (up to 88%) was converted to CO<sub>2</sub> via formate oxidation (flux C), and a smaller amount (at least 12%) flowed through the H<sub>4</sub>F module and into assimilation (flux E), representing at least 90% of the assimilatory carbon. In contrast, for methanol-grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030016-t001">Table 1</xref>), less (only about 70%) of the formaldehyde generated from methanol flowed through the H<sub>4</sub>MPT module (flux B), with up to 30% handled by the direct route (flux F). Only a small portion of the assimilatory carbon (suggested to be about 6%) flowed through the H<sub>4</sub>F module (flux E), which represented about 3% of the formate generated via the H<sub>4</sub>MPT module. The remainder of the formate was oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> (flux C). These data indicate that, although the relative contribution of the long route to methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F formation decreased during the transition to growth on methanol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g003">Figure 3</xref>), the flux through the long route (flux E) increased significantly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Flux through this route peaked 5 h after the transition to methanol, when it reached a value at least 8-fold higher than succinate-grown cells, and dropped somewhat afterward. The flux through the direct route (flux F) also increased to a maximum of up to 20% of the total formaldehyde flux at the final time point during the transition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The fluxes for the transition from methanol to succinate represent the capacity for flux, as no methanol was present after the growth transitions. These changes, however, roughly mirrored the transition from succinate to methanol, but were not an exact reversal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As noted for the deuterium-labeling experiments, the time periods followed in these experiments were sufficient to observe the majority of the transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Dynamic Mathematical Model of Formaldehyde Partitioning</title><p>In order to assess whether the known kinetic constraints of the three modules of formaldehyde metabolism were sufficient to account for the experimentally determined flux dynamics, a mathematical model was generated. The model simulated partitioning of C<sub>1</sub> units through the three formaldehyde modules during growth of cells in methanol, and for the transition of succinate-grown cells to methanol. The model consisted of eight ordinary differential equations, based on known kinetic mechanisms, to describe the dynamics of the H<sub>4</sub>F and H<sub>4</sub>MPT modules and the direct condensation reaction.

First, the model did not constrain the direction of flux through the H<sub>4</sub>F module. Therefore the prediction that the H<sub>4</sub>F module functions in assimilation both during steady-state methanol growth and upon the first exposure of succinate-grown cells to methanol indicates that the kinetic parameters of the module components are sufficient to account for this phenomenon. Second, the correspondence between the predicted and experimentally determined dynamics of the switch in methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F production routes confirms that the dynamics of the system are also largely attributable to the systems' kinetic constraints. That the kinetics did not exactly mimic the measured values is presumably partly due to differences between the actual induction of enzyme activities versus the model's simplifying assumption that all values change in a manner directly proportional to changes in methanol uptake. However, the model does not suggest a significant effect of methylene H<sub>4</sub>MPT-derived NADPD in the deuterium-labeling studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>The H<sub>4</sub>F Module Could Not Be Eliminated during Growth on C<sub>1</sub> Compounds</title><p>The combination of CD<sub>3</sub>OD and <sup>14</sup>C-methanol label-tracing studies clearly demonstrate that the long route contributes methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F to the serine cycle and that the flux through the H<sub>4</sub>F module portion of the long route (flux E) increases significantly during the transition to growth on methanol. These results confirm the hypothesis of net reductive flux through this module [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, this route contributes only 6% of the total methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F generated during growth on methanol. Therefore, it seemed possible that the H<sub>4</sub>F module might be required during transitions in and out of methylotrophy, but might not be required for continuous growth on methanol. Given the available genetic techniques, two strategies were employed in an attempt to obtain mutants in one of the key H<sub>4</sub>F module genes, formate-H<sub>4</sub>F ligase, during growth on C<sub>1</sub> compounds. First, attempts were made to obtain null mutants via allelic exchange with cultures maintained on methanol or methylamine, but these efforts were unsuccessful. Second, cultures of the <italic>&#x00394;ftfL::kan</italic> mutant CM216K.1 [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] bearing the complementing plasmid pCM218 [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] were grown in medium containing methanol or methylamine without tetracycline for plasmid maintenance. No plasmid-free isolates were obtained for CM216K.1 with pCM218 during growth on methanol. However, they were obtained for wild-type with pCM218 on methanol, or CM216K.1 with pCM218 grown on succinate. Therefore, it appears that the H<sub>4</sub>F module plays an essential role in methylotrophy even after cells have already begun to grow on C<sub>1</sub> compounds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the formaldehyde metabolism of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. extorquens</named-content> AM1, three interconnected metabolic modules are present, involved in two roles: converting formaldehyde to the key assimilatory intermediate methylene H<sub>4</sub>F and net oxidation of formaldehyde to CO<sub>2</sub>. Understanding paradigms for differential roles of redundant modules is central to enabling broadscale metabolic reconstruction from genome sequences. In addition, methylotrophy represents an intriguing example of a metabolic mode in which growth depends on high flux of a toxic metabolite, with subsequent partitioning of that metabolite. Other such modes are known that produce toxic aldehydes, for instance, growth on ethanolamine [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and other alcohols [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Numerous other toxic intermediates are known in bacteria, such as the production of hydroxylamine by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and mono-oxygenase-dependent production of epoxyalkanes during growth on aliphatic alkanes [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, the liver can be exposed to toxic metabolites, for instance, the production of formate from acute methanol poisoning [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the metabolic mechanisms that allow the balancing of flux and toxicity in such situations are not well understood. Understanding paradigms for such metabolic responses is important for assessing and possibly ameliorating toxicity problems in a variety of systems, including bioremediation of toxic compounds, chemical production in bioprocesses, and detoxification in tissues and organs.</p><p>Through a combination of <sup>14</sup>C and deuterium label-tracing strategies, we have defined flux through each metabolic module in methylotrophic metabolism in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. extorquens</named-content> AM1 during transitions into and out of methylotrophy, in which the flux of formaldehyde into the system changed by a factor of 10. These methods had the dual advantages of possessing sufficient sensitivity to detect flux under all conditions tested, and being free from the requirement of steady-state growth conditions, which allowed the dynamics of growth transitions to be examined. Furthermore, this approach complements a recently developed <sup>13</sup>C-labeling method that measures flux through the multicarbon branches of central metabolism [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but is inherently silent to the C<sub>1</sub> fluxes measured here. The approach described here allowed us to test and confirm the hypothesis that the role of the H<sub>4</sub>F module during growth on C<sub>1</sub> compounds is to supply methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F from formate [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], although the fraction of total flux passing through this route is always small.</p><p>Given the small percentage of total flux into assimilation via the H<sub>4</sub>F module during growth on methanol, why is this module required under this condition? The results presented here suggest that this requirement is not alleviated even when cells begin to actively grow on methanol. It is possible that this module generates an inducing signal for the serine cycle and, therefore, is necessary to maintain assimilatory flux during growth on methanol. This hypothesis is consistent with the genetic circuit, as two of the genes encoding key enzymes of the H<sub>4</sub>F module <italic>(mtdA</italic> and <italic>fch)</italic> are in an operon with serine-cycle genes and are under the control of a single regulatory protein, QscR [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Our results demonstrate a dramatic shift in flux through the primary methylotrophic modules during these transitions. It has long been known that all enzymes of methylotrophy increase 3&#x02013;6 fold in activity after induction with methanol [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], predicting a sizable increase in total flux into the system. However, the flux measurements reported here show that a dynamic repartitioning occurs also. When <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. extorquens</named-content> AM1 encounters methanol, the methanol oxidation system is at low but significant activity [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Under these conditions, the flux of formaldehyde into the system is relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g006">Figure 6</xref>, left panel), and most of the formaldehyde is oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> via the H<sub>4</sub>MPT module and formate dehydrogenase, generating NAD(P)H. Only a trace amount is assimilated, almost all of that through the long route involving formate and H<sub>4</sub>F intermediates. As the flux of formaldehyde into the system increases, a greater percentage begins to flow through the direct route into assimilatory metabolism. A smooth transition occurs during the induction of the capacity in the system until approximately one-third of the total formaldehyde flows through this route, and assimilatory and dissimilatory metabolism are balanced for rapid growth on methanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g006">Figure 6</xref>, right panel). The metabolic elegance of this interconnected, dynamic metabolic loop creates an effective formaldehyde flux buffer for transitions, in which the cell has time to respond to the presence of a methylotrophic substrate, deriving benefit (energy) without risking buildup of a toxic intermediate. As the activity of the serine cycle begins to increase, more formaldehyde can be safely shunted to assimilatory metabolism via the direct, ATP-independent route, thereby ensuring the transition to growth on the C<sub>1</sub> substrate without build up of formaldehyde.</p><fig id="pbio-0030016-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>An Interconnected Metabolic Loop for Handling the Toxic Intermediate Formaldehyde</title><p>A dynamic transition occurs from low to high formaldehyde flux, shifting the ratio of the direct versus long routes, and in the relative proportion of carbon oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> versus assimilated, creating a buffer system to accommodate large changes in formaldehyde flux.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030016.g006"/></fig><p>What controls the rate of the nonenzymatic condensation of formaldehyde with H<sub>4</sub>F to form methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F, which was up to 150-fold greater during methanol growth than on succinate? The rate of this spontaneous reaction will be determined by the relative concentrations of reactants and products, with an equilibrium constant for this condensation of 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although this equilibrium constant favors the production of methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F, flux will only occur if either the concentrations of the reactants (formaldehyde and/or H<sub>4</sub>F) rise above the equilibrium concentration, or utilization of methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F is sufficient to keep the pool of this metabolite below the equilibrium concentration. At this time, it is not technically feasible to measure the intracellular concentrations of free formaldehyde or methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F. However, the most likely explanation for high flux through the nonenzymatic condensation of formaldehyde and H<sub>4</sub>F would be draw-off of the product (methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F) by the serine cycle. In order to test whether the known kinetic parameters explain the relative utilization of the two methylene-H<sub>4</sub>F production routes, a kinetic model was constructed and utilized to simulate formaldehyde partitioning during transitions to and from methylotrophic growth. The ability of the model to recapitulate the observed switch in route utilization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030016-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) indicates that the architecture of the dynamic loop and the kinetic parameters of the responsible enzymes can predict operation of the H<sub>4</sub>F module in the assimilatory direction and are sufficient to account for partitioning of C<sub>1</sub> units into assimilatory metabolism without accumulation of formaldehyde.</p><p>In summary, the dual-labeling approach described here for direct flux measurement during metabolic transitions has not only elucidated a key role for redundancy in the three metabolic modules responsible for formaldehyde assimilation and dissimilation, but has also revealed a new paradigm for accommodating high-flux toxic intermediates. It is likely that similar interconnected loop systems operate for other metabolites, toxic or not, and this example can now be used as a framework for predicting functions of other apparently redundant modules that may be involved in the handling of toxic metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>Wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. extorquens</named-content> AM1 [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and mutant strains were cultured at 30 &#x000b0;C in a minimal salts medium [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] containing 125 mM methanol or 15 mM succinate.

Many of the values for V<sub>max</sub> could be directly calculated from specific activities found in the literature, for both growth on methanol and succinate. To allow for experimental error in the measured rate constants, and to account for the fact that kinetics measured in vitro do not necessarily correlate exactly with what occurs inside the cell, these values were allowed to vary within 50% during the fitting procedure described below. For the remaining parameters, a numerical error minimization technique was used to find the set of parameters yielding model predictions with the best fit to the experimental flux distributions, when integrated to steady state. This was first done for methanol growth, then repeated for succinate growth. The rate constant for spontaneous formaldehyde condensation (k<sub>6</sub>) was forced to be the same on succinate as on methanol, since this is a fundamental chemical property that is not affected by gene induction. All reverse rate constants were calculated directly from the forward constants, binding constants, and Keq. The spontaneous condensation of formaldehyde with H<sub>4</sub>MPT was assumed to be negligible under physiological conditions compared to the formaldehyde activating enzyme reaction [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. All simulations were performed in MATLAB 6.5 (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, United States) using the ODE solving function &#x0201c;ode15s.&#x0201d; The error minimization was also done in MATLAB, using an evolutionary algorithm written previously [<xref rid="pbio-0030016-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>
