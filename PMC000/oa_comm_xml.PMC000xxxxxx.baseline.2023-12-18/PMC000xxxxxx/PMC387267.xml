<article-title>A Window into the Brain Demonstrates the Importance of Astrocytes</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Large and long-lasting cytosolic calcium surges in astrocytes have been described in cultured cells and acute slice preparations. The mechanisms that give rise to these calcium events have been extensively studied in vitro. However, their existence and functions in the intact brain are unknown. We have topically applied Fluo-4 AM on the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and imaged cytosolic calcium fluctuation in astrocyte populations of superficial cortical layers in vivo, using two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Spontaneous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> events in individual astrocytes were similar to those observed in vitro. Coordination of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> events among astrocytes was indicated by the broad cross-correlograms. Increased neuronal discharge was associated with increased astrocytic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity in individual cells and a robust coordination of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals in neighboring astrocytes. These findings indicate potential neuron&#x02013;glia communication in the intact brain.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Two-photon laser scanning microscopy was used to image calcium concentration changes in astrocytes in the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Astrocytes are nonneuronal cells of the brain with some known and hypothesized functions (Kettenmann and Ransom 1995; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Fields1" ref-type="bibr">Fields and Stevens-Graham 2002</xref>). Traditionally, astrocytes have been considered to mediate supportive and protective functions in the central nervous system because of their strategic placement relative to the vasculature, and because they lack fast sodium action potentials. It is only recently that this family of glial cells has been implicated in controlling the dynamics of the neuronal networks in the central nervous system (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Nedergaard1" ref-type="bibr">Nedergaard 1994</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Parpura1" ref-type="bibr">Parpura et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Parri1" ref-type="bibr">Parri et al. 2001</xref>). Although the membrane potential of unidentified glial cells shows correlated changes with neuronal activity in vivo (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Amzica2" ref-type="bibr">Amzica and Steriade 2000</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Amzica1" ref-type="bibr">Amzica and Massimini 2002</xref>), most of our knowledge on neuron&#x02013;glia and glia&#x02013;glia communication comes from studies in vitro.</p><p>In cultured and acutely prepared astrocytes, free calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in the cytosol undergoes large changes spontaneously or in response to various physiological and pharmacological manipulations, such as mechanical stimulation, membrane potential depolarization, and activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Cornell-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">Cornell-Bell et al. 1990a</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Pasti1" ref-type="bibr">Pasti et al. 1997</xref>). These slow events are mediated by release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Charles2" ref-type="bibr">Charles et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Venance1" ref-type="bibr">Venance et al. 1997</xref>). The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> surges can be evoked by strong neuronal activity (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Dani1" ref-type="bibr">Dani et al. 1992</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">Porter and McCarthy 1996</xref>), suggesting a potential homeostatic role of astrocytes in the regulation of extracellularly accumulating neurotransmitters (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Verkhratsky1" ref-type="bibr">Verkhratsky et al. 1998</xref>). Conversely, spontaneous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes in astrocytes have been shown to influence neuronal excitability (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Parpura1" ref-type="bibr">Parpura et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Pasti2" ref-type="bibr">Pasti et al. 2001</xref>). The mechanism of activity propagation among astrocytes is controversial. In tissue cultures, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> events can propagate among a network of astrocytes via gap junction or by elevation of adenosine triphosphate level (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Cornell-Bell2" ref-type="bibr">Cornell-Bell et al. 1990b</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Charles3" ref-type="bibr">Charles et al. 1991</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Nedergaard1" ref-type="bibr">Nedergaard 1994</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Reetz1" ref-type="bibr">Reetz et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">Newman 2001</xref>). In the in vitro slice preparation, coordination of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity appears independent of gap junctions but may require transmitter activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and/or metabotropic glutamate receptors (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Parri1" ref-type="bibr">Parri et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Aguado1" ref-type="bibr">Aguado et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Nett1" ref-type="bibr">Nett et al.</xref>2002; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Tashiro1" ref-type="bibr">Tashiro et al. 2002</xref>). Moreover, the extent and magnitude of these network effects vary as a function of the preparation used, and can involve correlated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes in no, or only a few, neighboring astrocytes, or the whole population (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">Porter and McCarthy 1996</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Verkhratsky1" ref-type="bibr">Verkhratsky et al. 1998</xref>). Whether and how the observations in the various in vitro situations apply to the intact brain have yet to be determined.</p><p>We have used two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2-PLSM) to monitor cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in astrocytes labeled with Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester in juvenile rats in vivo. We find that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics in astrocytes is rather quiescent during baseline anesthesia. However, increased population bursting, brought about by attenuating &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor-mediated neurotransmission, leads to increased magnitude [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> surges, and the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes become more strongly coordinated in neighboring astrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Loading of Calcium-Sensitive Dye</title><p>To examine the depth of penetration of the Fluo-4 AM, coronal brain slices (300 &#x003bc;m thick) were acutely prepared after the residual dye was washed off from the craniotomy. A large number of cells below the craniotomy showed fluorescence labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020096-g001">Figure 1</xref>). On the basis of morphological appearance (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Videos S1-S4</xref>), most brightly labeled cells were astrocytes, in accordance with recent observations using a pressure application of the indicator (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Stosiek1" ref-type="bibr">Stosiek et al. 2003</xref>). The large overlap between Fluo-4 AM-loaded cells and astrocytes identified by S100B immunoreactivity provided confidence that most of the loaded cells were astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv005">Video S5</xref>). In addition to astrocytes, capillary endothelial cells and pericytes, outlining microvessels, were also observed, albeit less regularly. Some processes of astrocytes contacted local vessels. To quantify the dye penetration, mean bulk fluorescence intensity was plotted for different depths from the pial surface. Most intensive labeling occurred between 50&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;m below the surface (i.e., layers I/II), but labeled cells could be visualized at greater than 300 &#x003bc;m as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020096-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The decreased fluorescence on the surface is likely due to the diluting effect of the washout procedure in the superficial tissue. Like the histological appearance, in vivo imaging revealed numerous astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020096-g001">Figure 1</xref>E).

In subsequent experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 8 rats), cells with astrocytic appearance (<italic>n</italic> = 185) were selected for long-term (10&#x02013;20 min) monitoring. For quantitative studies, three states of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity were distinguished: (a) quiescent state with very slow (less than 0.025 Hz) oscillations of baseline fluorescence level, (b) [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spikes (greater than or equal to 20% increase in <italic>&#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub></italic> between 5&#x02013;50 s), and (c) [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> plateau potentials (greater than or equal to 20% increase in <italic>&#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub></italic> for greater than 50 s). [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spikes and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> plateau potentials were automatically detected. In the control (baseline) condition, 11% of astrocytes had at least one spike event, and 52% had at least one plateau event in 10 min. The mean frequency of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spikes among the cells that had at least one [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spike was 0.121 &#x000b1; 0.098 per minute (mean width at greater than or equal to 20% <italic>&#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub></italic>: 25.1 &#x000b1; 10.31 s) and the mean frequency of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> plateau was 0.118 &#x000b1; 0.058 per minute (mean duration: 160.4 &#x000b1; 114.9 s).</p><p>To investigate whether the baseline values of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics were affected by increasing neuronal activity, we induced regularly occurring population bursts by local application of bicuculline (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Bonhoeffer 2001</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 7 rats). Large amplitude (0.69 &#x000b1; 0.26 mV) synchronous field events (approximately 100 ms) occurred at relatively regular frequency (0.15 &#x000b1; 0.06 Hz), associated with multiple unit discharges. No significant difference was observed in average heartbeat frequency between the control sessions and bicuculline sessions (4.51 &#x000b1; 0.54 Hz and 4.36 &#x000b1; 0.74 Hz, respectively; paired t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13).</p><p>We used two methods to evaluate the effect of neuronal activity on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in astrocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 214 cells). First, the incidence of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spikes and plateau events was counted in the absence and presence of bicuculline-induced population bursts. Under bicuculline condition significantly more astrocytes had [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spikes (11% versus 24%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; Fisher's exact test), whereas the probability (52% versus 54%) of plateau potentials did not differ significantly. The mean duration of plateau potentials, however, was significantly longer (160.4 &#x000b1; 114.9 s versus 211.12 &#x000b1; 152.175 s; t-test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) after bicuculline treatment. Among the cells that exhibited at least one spike or plateau event, there was not a significant difference in frequency of the event occurrences (spike: 0.121 &#x000b1; 0.098/min versus 0.098 &#x000b1; 0.068/min; t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.24; plateau 0.118 &#x000b1; 0.058/min versus 0.112 &#x000b1; 0.049/min; t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.46). Thus, the major difference between control and bicuculline conditions was the higher proportion of active astrocytes under bicuculline.</p><p>The second method examined [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes in the frequency domain. The <italic>&#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub></italic> trace was considered as a continuous process, and the power spectrum estimate was calculated with a multi-taper method for each astrocyte and averaged across cells.

In our experiments, a large portion of the imaged astrocytes were active, showing either [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or plateau potentials. It is unlikely that the elevated activity in vivo is due to anesthesia because urethane is known to suppress transmitter release from presynaptic vesicles and attenuate both &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and NMDA receptors (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Hara1" ref-type="bibr">Hara and Harris 2002</xref>). Since blockade of these receptors decreases astrocytic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity in vitro (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Parri1" ref-type="bibr">Parri et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Aguado1" ref-type="bibr">Aguado et al. 2002</xref>), it is expected that in the drug-free animal the percentage of active cells will be even higher. A different explanation for the lower percentage of active astrocytes in the slice, relative to the in vivo situation and tissue culture preparation, is that the trauma of brain slicing attenuates spontaneous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity. Reactive astrocytes in a stab wound area show very limited [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Aguado1" ref-type="bibr">Aguado et al. 2002</xref>). In addition, the temperature at which the cells are kept may be playing an important role.</p><p>In the absence of provoking conditions, spontaneous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity in individual astrocytes does not spread among astrocytes as an intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Nett1" ref-type="bibr">Nett et al.</xref>2002). In baseline condition, the magnitude of correlated activity in nearby and distant astrocytes was quite similar. Nevertheless, the presence of zero-timelag correlation suggests that activity in the astrocytic syncytium in vivo is not random, but is under some coordinated control. Widespread but limited coordination of glial cells can be brought about by common synchronizing inputs in the intact brain, such as vascular and vegetative nervous system control or large-scale slow changes of neuronal excitability. The latter possibility is supported by the observation that ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and tetrodotoxin effectively decorrelated the astrocytic network without altering the number of active astrocytes (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Aguado1" ref-type="bibr">Aguado et al. 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the intact corticothalamic system displays substantial excitability fluctuation at the time scale of the astrocytic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> events (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Jando1" ref-type="bibr">Jando et al. 1995</xref>).</p><p>Although neuronal activity is not needed to generate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> surges in astrocytes (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Aguado1" ref-type="bibr">Aguado et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Nett1" ref-type="bibr">Nett et al.</xref>2002), neurotransmitters can enhance the frequency of such events. The impact of neuronal activity on the glial network is illustrated by the increased activity and enhanced local correlation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signal in astrocytes after regular population bursting of neurons was brought about by the GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor blocker bicuculline. These changes shared similarities to those observed in hippocampal and neocortical slices (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Aguado1" ref-type="bibr">Aguado et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Tashiro1" ref-type="bibr">Tashiro et al. 2002</xref>). In contrast to the slice situation, we did not find a time-locked triggering of astrocytic events to the neuronal bursts (see also <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Nett1" ref-type="bibr">Nett et al.</xref>2002). This discrepancy may be explained by the magnitude of the evoked neuronal bursts. Bicuculline in vitro evoked rare (greater than 30 s intervals), but very large bursts or afterdischarges (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Tashiro1" ref-type="bibr">Tashiro et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Aguado1" ref-type="bibr">Aguado et al. 2002</xref>). In vivo, synchronous events of moderate size occurred frequently (approximately 0.3 Hz). The enhanced bursts, associated with large field potentials, can be regarded as interictal epileptic spikes (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Bonhoeffer 2001</xref>), but seizures were never observed. Although the exact mechanisms of neuron&#x02013;astrocyte signaling remain to be disclosed, our findings indicate that neuronal and glial networks are coupled in the intact brain.</p><p>Many of the imaged astrocytes had processes (end feet) in close contact with small brain vessels (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al. 1970</xref>). It has been shown that surges of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in astrocytes trigger the release of vasoactive compounds (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Bezzi1" ref-type="bibr">Bezzi et al. 1998</xref>). Furthermore, stimulation of single astrocytes in cortical slices led to delayed (greater than 30 s) and protracted dilation of the contacted arteriole (<xref rid="pbio-0020096-Zonta1" ref-type="bibr">Zonta et al. 2003</xref>). These findings support the view that a cardinal function of astrocytes in the intact brain is to regulate local circulation according to the metabolic needs of neurons. Overall, the approach introduced in this paper will be a potent tool to investigate these issues in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Subjects and surgery</title><p>Male and female rats, 12&#x02013;16 d postnatal (P12&#x02013; P16), of the Sprague&#x02013;Dawley strain were used in these experiments. Animals were deeply anesthetized with 1.7 g/kg urethane. An outline of the craniotomy above the primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex was marked with a dental drill. A metal frame, similar to what has been described in <xref rid="pbio-0020096-Kleinfeld1" ref-type="bibr">Kleinfeld and Denk (2000</xref>), was attached to the skull with cyanoacrylic. A craniotomy (3&#x02013;4 mm diameter), centered at 1.5 mm posterior to bregma and 2.5 mm from midline, was performed and the dura mater was surgically removed. Care was taken to avoid any damage to pial vessels or the cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Dye loading</title><p>Fluo-4 AM (F-14201, 50 &#x003bc;g; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States) was mixed with 2 &#x003bc;l of Pluronic (P-3000, Molecular Probes) and 5 &#x003bc;l of dymethyl sulfoxide (D-8779; Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) for 15 min.

A small volume (up to 12 &#x003bc;l) of the dye-containing solution was applied to the cortical surface by a micropipette. The solution was retained in place by a small piece gelfoam. The unbound dye was removed 45&#x02013;60 min after the surface application of Fluo-4 AM by irrigating the exposed surface with ACSF for at least 10 min. The craniotomy was then covered with 1% agar dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and a glass coverslip was placed on a metal frame. This arrangement allowed access for a glass recording electrode from the side. Juvenile rats (P13&#x02013;P15) were used because we found in preliminary experiments that in adult animals, mostly vascular cells were loaded with the current protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>During the recording session, a heating blanket was placed under the rat to maintain body temperature at approximately 37&#x000b0;C.

In brief, a Ti:S laser (Mira 800F; Coherent, Santa Clara, California, United States) was pumped by a solid state CW laser (Verdi 8; Coherent) to produce a mode-locked beam (840 nm; approximately 100 fs pulse width at 76 MHz repetition rate). The beam was directed to a modified confocal scanhead (Fluoview 300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescent signal was first filtered with an emission filter (HQ525, passband 525 &#x000b1; 25 nm; Chroma, Rockingham, Vermont, United States) and detected by an external photo-multiplier tube (R-3896, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) with a built-in preamplifier board (F-5 PSU-B; Olympus).</p></sec><sec id="s4a5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Fluorescence signal was quantified by measuring the mean pixel value of a manually selected somatic area for each frame of the image stack using ImageJ software.

Sessions that had visible drifts when image sequences were replayed as animation (the majority of the cells showed correlated activity [<italic>|r|</italic> &#x0003e; 0.6], or greater than 10% fluorescence change due to the heartbeat when the cell was imaged in line scan [approximately 200 Hz]) were excluded from the analysis.

For the calcium event detection, <italic>&#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub></italic> signal was convolved with a Hanning window of order 15. &#x0201c;Spike&#x0201d; events were defined as transient increase of <italic>&#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub></italic> signal exceeding 20%, lasting 5&#x02013;50 s. &#x0201c;Plateau&#x0201d; events were defined as sustained increase of <italic>&#x00394;F/F<sub>0</sub></italic> (greater than 20%) signal longer than 50 s.

Following Fluo-4 AM loading, acute brain slices (300 &#x003bc;m thickness) were cut coronally around the dye-loaded area using standard procedures. Fluo-4 in cells of the acute brain slices were fixed by incubating the acute brain slices in freshly made saline containing 40 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC, E7750; Sigma) for 30 min. Next, the slices were incubated in formalin-based fixative (4% formaldehyde, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, [pH &#x0223c;7.1]) for 30 min. Once the fixation procedures were completed, the sections were mounted on a glass slide and imaged with 2-PLSM (z-stack; wavelength, 840 nm). After imaging of calcium-loaded cells, and three subsequent washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1.06 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 155.17 mM NaCl, 2.96 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, pH approximately 7.4), the slices were treated with S100B antibody (made in rabbit, 1:50 dilution) in Triton X-PBS (0.5% Triton X in PBS) overnight. The sections were subsequently washed three times in PBS, followed by incubation with the secondary fluorescent antibody (1:1000 dilution, 711-166-152, CY3 Anti-Rabbit IgG [H + L]; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pennsylvania, United States) in Triton X-PBS solution for 2 h.
